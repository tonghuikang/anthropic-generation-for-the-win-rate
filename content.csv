"Why do AI image generators have so much trouble rendering hands?

Tong Hui Kang
Machine Learning Engineer in Recommendations
The current AI image generators are not rewarded for drawing hands well.
The training input for image models is a huge set of images and their captions. The objective here is to fit a function f(caption) -> image, by minimizing some loss function L(caption, image).
L(caption, image) is high when the image is unrelated to the caption, and L(caption, image) is low when the image is very related to the caption. The image generation model is trained to minimize L(caption, image).
However, L(caption, image) might be high for images with deformities, because L(caption, image) might only measure whether the image is related to the caption.
If you don’t penalize deformities in the training, you can’t generate images free-of-deformities. As of my current understanding, generating images without deformities is still an open question."
"At what point do you consider an LLM to have an ability to plan?

Tong Hui Kang
Machine Learning Engineer in Recommendations
Consider the following query and response
User:
How many r are there in strawberry? Check your answer
Assistant:
There are 2 'r' letters in the word ""strawberry"".
To check this answer, let's break down the word:
s-t-r-a-w-b-e-r-r-y
We can see that there are indeed two instances of the letter 'r' in ""strawberry"":
1. The first 'r' comes after 't'
2. The second 'r' is the second-to-last letter
This confirms that the answer of 2 'r' letters is correct.

"How is your experience like doing a title transfer with the DMV Virtual Office?

Tong Hui Kang
Lives in San Francisco Bay Area (2021-present)
Generally, I do not recommend this, unless you know your seller really well. The process of doing a title transfer with the DMV Virtual Office is lengthy is prone to errors.
These are the alternatives I recommend
Spend a day queuing at the DMV to process the title transfer in-person
Schedule a visit to a AAA branch to process a title transfer, but I think they do charge a premium
If you still insist on doing a title transfer with the DMV Virtual Office, I describe the steps that I have gone through.
This video from the DMV describes the initial steps you need to go through
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...
I want to emphasize some things in this process
The order of the first name and the last name is not conventional on the title transfer form. Please READ carefully.
If a smog test was done on the vehicle recently, you should include the smog test certification in the Additional Related Documents, in case they ask for it. This may save you one email exchange.
You will also need to submit the Notice of Transfer and Release of Liability online. This lets DMV know that the seller is no longer responsible for parking/traffic violations or civil or criminal actions associated with the vehicle after the date of sale.
That is the easy part. You will receive an email with a case number where you can check the status of your case. Note that the page does not always load and you may need to refresh multiple times for the information to be displayed.
Now the hard part begins. You don’t know whether you have done the steps correctly. This is why I recommend spending a day in-person at the DMV or schedule a visit at the AAA branch instead, because the errors will be surfaced on the spot.
Additional documents might be requested. In my case, the Smog Certificate was requested.


I submitted my Smog Certificate by replying to the email they sent. After I submitted my Smog Certification, for quite some time I was unsure whether they have received my Smog Certificate. But if you look carefully in the screenshot, you see “Additional files were received with this case and are under review”, which is not obvious.
When they are satisfied with your softcopy documents, you will need to make a payment. Note there there is an additional 2% for using a credit or debit card. The alternative involves sending some account and routing numbers which could take days to execute, so I would rather pay the extra 2%.
After they have confirmed that they have received the payment, you will need to send the original title by mail. This is why I recommend that you use DMV Virtual Office if you know the seller well, because the title might get lost in the way.


I used USPS Priority Mail, which was around $10, to mail the original title. If you feel rich you could use Priority Mail Express, which is faster and costs $30. I sent my mail at a USPS Post Office. I needed to handwrite my full address and the DMV’s address on the USPS envelope and hope that the computer parses my handwriting correctly. The destination is apparently a mailbox (PO box) where DMV will retrieve the documents from once in a while.
USPS Priority Mail has tracking. It was recorded that the mail reached the PO box on Monday noon. However, my document is only processed on Thursday noon.
The process, when complete, should look something like this.

"What’s an interesting application of game theory in everyday life?

Tong Hui Kang
Took a Game Theory course in college
Divorce.
You are splitting from your significant other (or maybe just your housemate).
You collectively own an asset, say, the water purifier (which happens to be the most expensive item that my housemate and I collectively own).
You value the water purifier at $150.
Your housemate values the water purifier at $250.
This is a complete information game, the valuations of the water purifier is public.
You and your housemate submit a bid at the same time. The winner pays the smaller of either bids to the loser. In case of a tie, a coin is tossed to determine the winner.
Let’s say you bid $180 and your housemate bids $200. Your housemate will pay you $180 and get the water purifier.
You will get a payoff of $180 - the money that your housemate paid you.
Your housemate will get a payoff of $250 - $180 = $70, because your housemate gets the water purifier but pays you $180.
The question here is - what is the optimal bidding strategy?
Should you always bid no more than how much you value the water purifier, so that you guarantee that you will never get a negative payoff?
Because you get paid the losing bid if you lose, could you bid higher but still try to lose, to maximize the amount of money you get from your winning housemate?
Here is a picture of our water purifier if you don’t want to look at the answer immediately.


According to o1-mini, both players will bid half of the higher valuation. I think the mathematics looks correct, but might be wrong. But this is still a game theory problem.
I thought of this problem a few years ago, but I think it should have been a homework problem somewhere already.
I hope this answer helps you in your divorce proceedings."

Tong Hui Kang
Machine Learning Engineer in Recommendations
Train your train of thought. Do you read the question correctly? Why did you misread the question? Think of what you were wasting time thinking of, and whether you could have avoided that line of thought.
Could you have written code in a way that is less prone to errors? Why did you get confused by your own code? Why did you use the wrong variable in that line of code? Having descriptive and consistent variable names helps (and it also helps your interviewer understand your code too).
Reflect on whether could you have done it given your knowledge. You know binary search, you know Dijkstra, why did you think of using these two to solve the problem? Reflect why you did not manage to use that knowledge.
Are there templates you should collect and reuse? Do you really need to recall from scratch some of the algorithms? If keep a handbook of common algorithms it will make your implementation faster. For interviews, you might still need to understand and memorize these templates."
"Should you fine-tune from a base model or an instruct model?

Tong Hui Kang
Machine Learning Engineer in Recommendations
Understand the definitions of pre-training, post-training, and fine-tuning.
- Pre-training is the stage where you take all the text from the Internet and train a next-token predictor. The output is a base model. Note that this base model is not useful for downstream applications (you can try to experience it yourself with OpenAI davinci-002).
- Post-training is the stage where you align the model to make coherent replies to user questions. There is a paper (Less is More for Alignment) that says 1000 examples in enough. I think the actual number should be in the millions. There are different methods to do post-training - SFT, RLHF, and DPO, just to name a few. We call the data used in post-training the post-training dataset. The output is an instruct model.
- Fine-tuning is the stage where you give the model a small amount of examples (50 to 100) so that the model produces responses in a style that you want. The output is a fine-tuned model.
There is a lot of work done in the post-training that you might want to inherit. Models fine-tuned from instruct models should know how to handle multi-turn conversations even though your fine-tuning dataset may consist of only single-turn responses. Models fine-tuned from instruct models inherit the safeguards that you might want for free. Models fine-tuned from instruct models inherit some ability to handle out-of-sample queries.
You need more examples to fine-tune from a base model. For the base models, OpenAI mentioned in 2022 that needed to “aim for at least ~500 examples”. For the instruct models OpenAI recommends “starting with 50 well-crafted demonstrations”. For instruct models, you can see that the model is imitating the style of your fine-tuning dataset with only 10 examples. For base models, you need many more examples before you can feel the difference between from base model you fine-tuned from. It is more encouraging to fine-tune from an instruct model where you can see progress with a little manual work, compared to fine-tuning from a base model.
OpenAI seems to prefer that you fine-tune from their instruct models. OpenAI’s current fine-tuning guide is focused on fine-tuning instruct models. I had to dig the archives for the statement that base models need at least 500 examples. OpenAI also considers its completion APIs as legacy.
The open-source community tends to prefer to fine-tune from base models. For most models, even the open-weights models, the post-training dataset is not published. You do not know exactly what the model is tuned to do or not to do. A base model is a compression of the Internet and is mostly unopinionated, whereas the post-training dataset is very opinionated on what should the intended response be.
The instruct model tends to be less creative than the base model. In May 2023, Andrej Karpathy shared that if he wanted a model that generates Pokemon names, he would use a base model to do that. The base model has lots of entropy and gives lots of diverse outputs. Therefore, if you want to generate more diverse outputs, you might want to fine-tune from the base model."
"Should you still include a prompt when fine-tuning?

Tong Hui Kang
Machine Learning Engineer in Recommendations
The point of fine-tuning is to avoid writing prompts. In OpenAI’s fine-tuning guide, fine-tuning is only recommended when it’s easier to “show, not tell”. This therefore raises the question on whether do we still need to include a prompt when fine-tuning.
However, I still suggest that you use a prompt and a concise one. For example, you want a solution that summarizes the content of the email in the title. A solution from pure prompt engineering would include long instructions on capitalization, what to focus on, and content length, for example. The prompt, when you do fine-tuning, should be just “Summarize the content of the email as a title”.
There is this idea that it is easier to learn from the mistakes that you make, compared to the mistakes that someone else has made. It also means that it is easier to repeat what you could have done rather than what someone else could have done. It is more likely for the pre-fine-tuned model to arrive at your intended email titles if you include a concise prompt. I have not studied the research backing up this idea here.
However, with more input tokens, it will cost more in terms of compute, and therefore more money.
I don’t think you should include any more than the minimum context here. I expect that the model will learn style from your fine-tuning dataset, and having very detailed prompts might detract from that objective. Again, I have not studied the research backing up this idea here.
Note that if you include a prompt in the fine-tuning dataset, you need to make sure you include the same prompt in production in the same exact format."
"Should you fine-tune an LLM, or just do prompt engineering?

Tong Hui Kang
Machine Learning Engineer in Recommendations
You should always start with the simplest solution. The simplest solution is prompt engineering. See these arguments for simplicity. By shipping, you get to see what prompt engineering can achieve. You also have access to data that could be used to fine-tune your model.
Fine-tuned models may be cheaper for the same performance. There are claims where you can achieve GPT-4 performance with a 7B model which can be served for cheap. However, the benchmark you need to beat now is Claude-3-Haiku, which is $0.25/$1.25. General-purpose LLMs are only getting cheaper over time, whereas the cost to serve your fine-tuned model is the same. General-purpose LLMs are easier to serve at scale because they can batch multiple requests.
You should also consider the cost of shipping a solution with fine-tuning. You need to think of how much you are getting paid. If you spend one engineer-month to fine-tune something to reduce a yearly cost of $500 to $200, are you really saving costs?
Fine-tuning may not solve your problem if prompt engineering can’t. If you cannot prompt engineer your way to generate a good response at least 10% of the time, fine-tuning will not save you. Fine-tuning only changes the style of the response. Fine-tuning does not increase the capabilities of the model or truly give the model new knowledge.
Try squeezing performance out of prompt engineering and function calling first. You might be not correctly doing prompt engineering. You can provide feedback to general-purpose LLM. If you want to build a chatbot that writes a certain flavor of SQL, just execute the SQL and provide the error feedback to the chatbot. General-purpose LLMs may just adopt the feedback pretty well.
There are many pitfalls that come along with fine-tuning. For prompt engineering, it is obvious if it works. If it does not work, change the prompt. For fine-tuning, if it does not work, it is not easy for a beginner to know what went wrong. There are many places where it could go wrong.
Collecting a fine-tuning dataset is hard. Collecting a good fine-tuning dataset is not easy If writing a 100-word prompt is hard, collecting a 100-example fine-tuning dataset is even harder.
It is possible that prompt engineering is harder than fine-tuning. In cases where it is easier to show rather than tell, fine-tuning makes more sense. It might be easier to collect and show 100 or 1000 examples than to write lengthy instructions for the model. An example of this use case is to generate interview questions based on the interviewee’s background. It is really hard to put down in words the qualities of a good question. Few-shot prompts may not work because they do not fully describe what you want. You will need to change the prompt when you change the model. Each model has their idiosyncrasies that you might need to specifically prompt against. New models are better and cheaper and old proprietary models will be deprecated. If you have a good fine-tuning dataset, you could probably just use the same dataset.
You might need a fine-tuning dataset anyway. If you making serious LLM applications, you need evaluation even if you are only doing prompt engineering. The fine-tuning dataset can be repurposed into an evaluation dataset.
It depends on the current state of the art. It depends on whether are there powerful models available to fine-tune. It depends on whether the performance of general-purpose models is much better than the models available to fine-tune. It depends on whether there are used platforms for fine-tuning. It depends on whether are there easy-to-use platforms for prompt engineering. It depends on the prices of calling general-purpose models versus deployed fine-tuned models.
You just need to do fine-tuning anyway. You might just need to write a paper on how fine-tuning a certain dataset can “achieve a performance better than GPT-4” on a certain specific task. Or your client is paying you money and they do not appreciate a 100-word well-written prompt with rigorous evaluations. You want to build capability for your organization, or you want to tick certain checkboxes for yourself. It is still good for the company if there are a few people who know the nature of fine-tuning. Instead of regarding fine-tuning as a cure-all solution only if you had more staffing, it is good to know what are you missing (or what are you not missing). If this is the actual reason to fine-tune, you need to be aware and be honest."
"How do I efficiently query a small random sample with Trino?

Tong Hui Kang
Machine Learning Engineer in Recommendations
Usually if you want a random sample, you could do something like
WITH products (product_id, product_name, price) AS (
    VALUES
    (1, 'Apple', 0.30),
    (2, 'Orange', 0.50),
    (3, 'Banana', 0.25),
    (4, 'Mango', 1.50),
    (5, 'Blueberry', 2.00),
    (6, 'Grapes', 0.80),
    (7, 'Kiwi', 0.70),
    (8, 'Pineapple', 3.50),
    (9, 'Watermelon', 5.00),
    (10, 'Peach', 0.90)
)
SELECT product_id, product_name, price
FROM products
ORDER BY RANDOM()
LIMIT 4

This will produce something like
 | product_id | product_name | price | 
 | ---------- | ------------ | ----- | 
 | 3          | Banana       | 0.25  | 
 | 2          | Orange       | 0.50  | 
 | 1          | Apple        | 0.30  | 
 | 8          | Pineapple    | 3.50  | 

There is this step where it does ORDER BY RANDOM(), which can be inefficient, as sorting is O(n log n). I am not sure if the query engine recognizes that you are limiting after sorting and does some query optimization.
In PrestoDB there is this reservoir_sample where it does reservoir_sampling which is O(n+k). However, to my current knowledge, this has not been implemented in Trino.

“gpt2-chatbot” on LMSYS Chatbot arena is rumored to be the next OpenAI model.
There is this ongoing Kaggle competition where you get an LLM to solve Math Olympiad problems.

It got 4 out of 10 correct at zero-shot (zero prompting involved, I only used the question statement only).
https://www.kaggle.com/competiti...
I like how it does step-by-step reasoning in a manner not seen in the current models. The issue with the low-tier models is that they produce responses that look good but are actually obviously wrong. “gpt2-chatbot” does not pretend that they have an answer every time.
The model still produces obviously wrong output though, like giving numbers that are obviously not a geometric sequence to the question “There exists a unique increasing geometric sequence of five 2-digit positive integers. What is their sum?”
With better prompting and tool use, I think the model could solve all of the sample problems."
"What is the difference between image generation models Stable Diffusion 3 and Stable Diffusion 3 Turbo?

Tong Hui Kang
Machine Learning Engineer in Recommendations
Stable Diffusion 3 (SD3) and Stable Diffusion 3 Turbo (SD3-Turbo) are image models offered by Stability AI. [1][2]
Unlike previous models published by Stability AI, SD3 and SD3-Turbo were not open-weights models when they were published.
As of writing, SD3 costs 6.5 cents per image, whereas SD3-Turbo costs 4 cents per image.[3] This is competitive with DALL·E 3 at 4 cents per image, which has a similar performance.[4]
This article [5] from Stability AI describes how they distilled SD3-Turbo from SD3. In the abstract, the article states that
We introduce Latent Adversarial Diffusion Distillation (LADD), a novel distillation approach overcoming the limitations of ADD.
We apply LADD to Stable Diffusion 3 (8B) to obtain SD3-Turbo, a fast model that matches the performance of state-of-the-art text-to-image generators using only four unguided sampling steps.

In summary, SD3-Turbo is a distillation of SD3. In layperson language, SD3-Turbo is a smaller model (which is cheaper and faster to run) compared to SD3. The performance of SD3-Turbo might be slightly worse than SD3.
Here are some images generated with SD3 versus SD3-Turbo, at the boundary of their abilities:

Tong Hui Kang
Software Engineer (2021-present)
Devin is an autonomous agent that solves engineering tasks through the use of its own shell, code editor, and web browser. This is their demo on Twitter, for reference.
Assume we have a business where
You need help on a software engineering problem (e.g. how to exit vim, find the best prompt for a classification task where you already have the data, how to build a chatbot that writes SQL and runs SQL queries served with an API)
You make a video call to the business platform, and a human software engineer (a competent one, but one that you have never worked with) answers your call.
You work with the software engineer to solve the problem. You may allow the software engineer to use tools, like browsing the Internet or taking over your computer to write and execute code.
The human software engineer working in this business has a real risk of getting out of job in the next few years with a tool like Devin.
The software engineer could only work on one thing at the time, the AI can run in parallel trying out different approaches at the same time.
The AI can fully document their plans and thought process. It is very tedious for the human software engineer to do that.
However, there is a few things to note here
Every time you make a new call, you need provide the necessary context to the software engineer.
You still need to spend quite a lot more time with the AI software engineer, compared to a new hire who has worked for a few months.
You do not trust the AI software engineer to make changes without your explicit approval.
There might be advances in technology that allow the AI software engineer to learn the organization’s practices and tastes as you interact with it. I think that technology development will take some time.

John Oliver went to fix this by marrying a cabbage on stage, and the result is this iconic 2-by-2 matrix you usually see in the Midjourney Discord servers.


In 15 February 2024, OpenAI released Sora, and it is a huge leap from the state-of-the-art of AI-generated videos.
A few days later, Will Smith filmed himself actually eating spaghetti in the comical manner depicted in the AI-generated videos just a year prior, and claiming that AI videos “is getting out of hand”.

"How is AI revolutionizing everyday tasks in the data science industry?

Tong Hui Kang
Machine Learning Engineer in Recommendations
You no longer need to memorize all the complex SQL keywords.
For example, you have this task
given a table of uid, transition_unix_time, calculate the intervals

There are chatbots that are able to translate your human language query into working SQL code.
WITH transitions (uid, transition_unix_time) AS (
    VALUES
    (1, 1610000000),
    (1, 1610003600),
    (1, 1610007200),
    (2, 1610000800),
    (2, 1610004400),
    (3, 1610005000)
)
SELECT
    uid,
    transition_unix_time,
    transition_unix_time - LAG(transition_unix_time) OVER (PARTITION BY uid ORDER BY transition_unix_time) AS interval
FROM transitions
ORDER BY uid, transition_unix_time
LIMIT 10

The chatbot is also able to run the code and verifies that it works. You can also ask for follow-ups, like
include more data in the mock table, calculate the standard deviation for each user and filter intervals that are greater than a standard deviation

When you are happy with the result of the chatbot, you can then copy over the query, edit it, and use the edited query on the actual business data.
In the future, you might not even need to edit it. The AI might actually be able to directly access and query the actual business data and directly give you the insights."
"How can one keep track of new vocabulary when learning Japanese?

Tong Hui Kang
Machine Learning Engineer in Recommendations
On Duolingo there is a tab where it keeps track of all the words that you have learnt. However, there is only two types of ordering on Duolingo, recently learned and “alphabetical”.


I wanted a better view of the words that I have learnt. For example, I want all the words that I can use to describe a person, for example,しずか (quiet) にぎやか (lively) かわいい (cute, pretty) おもしろい (interesting, fun, funny).
I could get GPT-4 to build word clusters like this.


It needs refinement though, for example I do want to separate the adjectives that can be used to describe a person from other adjectives. Regardless, this is a much better starting point compared to manually indexing the words yourself.
When you want to add a bunch of new words, you do not need to start from scratch. You could also get GPT-4 to read everything you have learnt and then suggest ways where the new words should go to."

Tong Hui Kang
Learning Japanese to avoid reading subtitles
The Japanese writing system uses a combination of logographic kanji, which are adopted Chinese characters, and syllabic hiragana and katakana. Learning the hiragana and katakana is something like alphabet in English.
As someone who already have some knowledge of Chinese and English, I hope not to start from zero when learning the alphabet. This is a mnemonic that I am using to memorize the hiragana. The initial suggestion was produced by GPT-4, but I have made edits.

At the highest ""Code Black"" category, above 33 degrees celsius, heat injury risk is very high. Troops work 15 minutes at a stretch, followed by 30 minutes rest.

This is a safety measure. There is no point in physical training if the result is injury, or worse, death.
Every death of a Singapore soldier is national news. Even though sovereignty is important and Singapore is paying the price with money and, occasionally human lives, we still cannot justify soldiers dying during peacetime training.
My sense is that Singaporeans are more concerned about the safety of their soldiers over the increase in safety regulations during training."
"In writing resume bullet points, should I use the Google XYZ formula or the STAR format?

Tong Hui Kang
Software Engineer at Quora
The STAR format consists for four parts - Situation, Task, Action, Results. These two resources describes the STAR format.
This is how a STAR format bullet point in a tech resume would look like
Worked with three other engineers in the mobile team (situation) to fix slow loading issues (task). Optimized GraphQL request waterfalls (action) and reduced page loading time by 10% (result).

The Google’s XYZ formula suggests that you write your bullet point in the following format - Accomplished X, as measured by Y, by doing Z
The above bullet point could have been summarized in Google XYZ formula as
Reduced mobile page loading time (X) by 10% (Y) from optimizing GraphQL request waterfalls (Z)

The advantage of Google XYZ formula is that you put your achievement in front, where it is most likely read. The situation and task is not the most important information in the story (though you might want to postface your bullet point that you worked “with three other engineers”).
However, in interviews, STAR format provide a structure for you to build your story. It is also easier to insert additional detail into the story - for example how did you triage the cause of the slow loading times, the challenges that you have faced.
The recommendations here are different because the setting of the resume screen and the interview session is different. In the resume screen, time is limited and hiring managers are trying to find a reason to accept or reject your resume, whereas in interviews you should have their full attention."
"What do you think of the newly imposed plastic bag charge in Singapore?

Tong Hui Kang
Machine Learning Engineer in Recommendations
From July 3 this year, customers will have to fork out at least 5 cents for each plastic bag that they take from large supermarket operators in Singapore.
https://www.channelnewsasia.com/...
This is required by law, which refers to plastic bags as “disposable carrier bags”.
https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Acts-Supp...
Here is some related conversation on Reddit.
https://www.reddit.com/r/singapo...
I have previously (four years ago) wrote an opinion.
Tong Hui Kang's answer to Do you think that Singapore supermarkets should impose a levy on plastic bags?
My opinions have changed. I don’t oppose such a charge now, and now I see there is some merit to it. However, I still don’t think we should have strong opinions against both options.
Currently at where I live in California, there is a plastic bag charge of 10 cents per bag. People here just seem to accept the fact and honestly declare at the self-checkout counter in the grocery store on how many store-provided bags do they use. I pretty much have accepted the fact too - but that was mainly because there are other facts I still couldn’t accept.
I also visited Taipei once, they also impose a similar plastic bag charge. Interestingly, that plastic bags in Taipei have a fancy hologram label.
https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyi...
The plastic bag charge did change my behavior in California.
If I am buying only a few items I do not request for a plastic bag. For some items like a carton of eggs, I would have definitely requested for a plastic bag if there was not a charge, but now I would only request a bag only if I am buying more items. I will take the risk of having my eggs broken.
If I am buying many things from a grocery store, my housemate and I will try to remember to bring some plastic bags. There might be some plastic bags stored in the car that I use, but I am not too sure about that right now. (Of course, you should not keep to many visible things in your car to reduce the chances of getting your window smashed.)
I don’t see the point of driving to my house to get plastic bags if I forgot to have them in the car. The additional mileage and risk taken is not worth it, neither it is environmentally friendly. I see the plastic bag charge as a penalty for forgetting to bring a plastic bag.
I do not use a wastepaper basket for our trash can. When I was raised in Singapore we had been using a wastepaper basket for the entire house of four. The 3-gallon wastepaper basket sized trash can is lined with a 3-gallon plastic bag from the grocery store. When the trash can is full, we wrap it and throw it down the rubbish chute. On hindsight, this is quite an inefficient process because every time the trash is full, someone in the house needs to bend their back, tie the bag and throw it down the chute. Currently where I live in California, we have a 13 gallon trash can and a 13 gallon trash bag which costs $9 for 45 bags (20 cents per bag). We bag our trash and throw it probably once a week, we should have done this in Singapore too.
Of course, in Singapore you can express you frustration at the ballot box. However, please note that the Worker’s Party also called for the introduction of a single-use plastic charge."

Tong Hui Kang
Machine Learning Engineer in Recommendations
There is this “brain teaser” posted on Twitter

You can only ask one question to one guard to determine which door leads to freedom. What is the simplest question you ask the truth-telling guard?

This is what GPT-4 answered.
You don't need to know which guard is the truth-teller to solve this problem. Instead, ask either guard the following question:
""If I were to ask the other guard which door leads to freedom, what would they say?""
Both guards will point to the door leading to captivity. If you ask the truth-telling guard, they will honestly tell you that the lying guard would point to the door leading to captivity. If you ask the lying guard, they will lie about the truth-telling guard's response and also point to the door leading to captivity.
In both cases, the answer to your question will be the door leading to captivity. Knowing this, choose the other door to find freedom.

If you understood the question, this is a completely wrong answer. You simply ask the truth-telling guard which door leads to freedom."

"Is SUTD less stressful than NUS/NTU?

Tong Hui Kang
Machine Learning Engineer in Recommendations
There is a saying for most courses in Singapore public universities - Once admitted, it is easy to finish, it is difficult to excel.
Your stress levels depends on how much you want.
There is freedom how much effort you want to put in. You can choose to put in the bare minimum effort for your projects and examinations, or you can choose to get to the top of the class. You can choose to complete just one unremarkable internship to fulfill graduation requirements, or you can choose to hustle and grind for the most coveted internships.
This is what I summarize as the main differences between SUTD and NUS/NTU
The first year in SUTD is held in the classroom, which mean you will interact with the same classmates for all courses for two or three semesters.
The first year in SUTD is common. The classmates you work with in the first year may not get the same degree with you i.e. “interdisciplinary experience”.
Most courses have group projects.
The cohort size of SUTD is small (still around 400 to 500).
If you are aiming for the top grades, doing well by yourself alone is not sufficient. As SUTD has more course projects, you need to get your project group mates to contribute. It is also not feasible to do all the work for your course projects. This could contribute to stress.
You are more likely to have more friends and acquaintances from the first year you spend together in SUTD. This might contribute to less stress. Or more.
As SUTD is an engineering-focused university with an unsurprising gender ratio, if you are a heterosexual male looking for a traditional relationship, you might feel more stress. Or less, if you do not care about a relationship.
As the cohort size is small, there is less flexibility for the curriculum. Most required classes are only held once per year. If you fail the course, you usually could only retake the course in one year later. This might give significant pressure if you are failing the course. This could contribute to stress.
There is less awareness of how high the ceiling is, because of the small cohort size. Throughout my years, I am not aware of anyone in my cohort who scored a Bay Area internship, or interned at Google and Facebook in Singapore. I thought that was simply impossible. There are people who did that in NUS (probably not as often in NTU), see Reddit thread for reference. You would not need to go through the stress of not winning a lottery if you are not aware that there is even one in the first place."
"Do Singaporean students buy their textbooks? If so, where do they buy them from?

Tong Hui Kang
Machine Learning Engineer in Recommendations
Actually an interesting question.
In Primary school (Year 1–6) and Lower Secondary school (Year 7–8), we have a booklist that is produced by the school. It looks something like this. [1]


As mentioned in the booklist, you can buy the books in the school bookshop. Apparently, some books are cheaper in a nationwide bookstore Popular bookstore compared to the school bookshop, and parents might save a few dollars buying from there. Probably I might not had paid attention, I did not remember anyone reusing a textbook, other than one possibly from their elder sibling. There are donation drives [3] where you can donate and collect textbooks.
You see that there are textbooks and activity books. Lessons are conducted with the textbook. Homework is written in the activity book. When the homework is due, the activity book is passed to the teacher, who will mark the homework and return the activity book in the next lesson or two.
For Upper Secondary school (Year 9–10) and Junior College (Year 11–12), there are no longer activity books (at least in the secondary school that I have studied in).


The studies in Upper Secondary is geared towards preparation for the national examinations, such as the O levels. There are no longer activity books that you need to submit, but there is still (a lot of) homework. Homework is now printed in A4 paper, and you write your solutions on the paper or on additional foolscap papers. Students might need to pay for printing.
There might not be a market for Upper Secondary activity books because teachers want to decide exactly what questions should the students work on for homework. The student cohorts in different classes or different schools can vary significantly in their academic ability, and it is hard to craft a one-size-fits-all problem set.
For math and science subjects, you see that there is also these topical books. It is a required purchase, even though I don’t remember opening these books at all. The questions found in the A4-printed homework are actually from these topical books. The school requires the students to buy these books to protect the school from copyright lawsuits.
Students will also need to buy the Ten Year Series (TYS). The TYS contains the questions from the national examinations from the past ten years, and will be heavily used closer to the dates of the national examinations. Again, this is a required purchase to protect the school from lawsuits. A class representative will be collecting the money from everyone in the class.
In Junior College, we do not have textbooks anymore. The content is mostly delivered the slides, which will be uploaded into school learning management portal. Students are still required to buy books with the problem statements and Ten Year Series (or Thirty Year Series) for the same reason.

"If I am a student councilor in Singapore, do I get a minus 2 point for L1R5?

Tong Hui Kang
Machine Learning Engineer in Recommendations
Thanks for the A2A.
L1R5 is the admission criteria for junior colleges in Singapore, based on your O level results.
https://www.moe.gov.sg/post-seco...
This document details the grading system for the two bonus points for L1R5.


For the two bonus points, you need a minimum Level 3 in all four domains with at least a Level 4 in one domain. You can read the document for what qualifies for each domain.
It seems that if you have been participating in activities your class or your CCA peers has organized for you, it should be easy for you to hit Level 3 in all domains, and probably a Level 4 in some domain.
What is the most challenging is the leadership component, which require you to step up for the role. If you are a student councilor, there should be plenty of opportunities for you to complete one of the criteria here.


Ultimately, it is not who you are, but what you do.
Hope this answer is better than people (or bots) who could not judge whether an LLM generated answer is adding any value to this question."

Tong Hui Kang

I think it is more of an issue with your manager or mentor or the company processes rather than the issue with the intern.
Your manager should have planned to have your first code submissions to be simple.
Even for large scale implementations later in your tenure, we would expect most of the comments to happen during the design rather than during the implementation.
Usually code review comments are only about the implementation - whether is your implementation is correct, whether your implementation follows standards (naming, comments, for example), or are about clarification questions (whether have you checked something, for example)."

"How common is it for foreign students studying in Singapore government schools to take the Singapore Mother Tongue subject such as Chinese?

Tong Hui Kang
Machine Learning Engineer in Recommendations
Taking a Mother Tongue subject is not necessary for most foreign students, unless they happen to already have studied the language previously.
https://www.moe.gov.sg/primary/c...
If the foreign student enters the school system like everyone else in Primary One, they can take a Mother Tongue like everyone else. It is not unusual to drop the class as well, with approval from the Ministry of Education.
If the foreign student enters the school system later, they can take the class at the same level if they have similar proficiency."
"Is it true that FAANG programmers make their code over-complicated to prevent hackers from understanding them?

Tong Hui Kang
Machine Learning Engineer in Recommendations
to prevent hackers from understanding them

You might be referring to code obfuscation.


If you look at the code that is used to render the Facebook page, it is unintelligible. It makes it difficult to understand what is going on because variable and method names are encoded.
It is intended to make it slightly more difficult for crawlers to crawl Facebook, or extensions to edit Facebook’s content.
This is different from most of the answers to this question which talks about the source code. The programmers edit the source code, and the source code is used to generate the object code.
Programmers don’t obfuscate the object code themselves, they use automated tools do that."
"How good is Python for competitive programming?

Tong Hui Kang
Machine Learning Engineer in Recommendations
I agree that you should not use Python if you are doing competitive programming competitively.
These are the situations where you should not learn Python
IOI and related contests (Only C++ is allowed for IOI 2022)
ICPC and related contests (good luck finding good teammates who also use Python)
Even if you are doing competitive programming non-competitively, these are the obstacles that you may face
Problems where the time constraints are tight. Sometimes, the author intends to disallow O(n3) solutions but allow O(n2 log n) solutions. Your Python solution, even though implemented in O(n2 log n), may be evaluated as Time Limit Exceeded.
Problems with strong memory constraints. Some problems on Codeforces impose unusual memory constraints as little as 32MB. These problems may require the use of variables with a small bit length (like C++ short), which is not a feature of Python.
Python grandmasters are few and far in between. There has only been one person who uses only Python, never C++, and reached Grandmaster.
However, Python is actually a good language for non-competitive competitive programming.
Most of the problems that solution will fail because you do not have a correct algorithm, not because of Python implementation.
When you start out competitive programming, you want to learn to craft and implement algorithms fast. Python code is less verbose, and concepts can be seen more clearly.
C++ is not that friendly to beginners - for example you need understand and juggle types and pointers. The same points that discusses what should be your first programming language also apply here.
The most recent problem that Python gave me a bunch of TLE is Question 4 of a recent Google Kick Start problem.
https://codingcompetitions.withg...
There are also a few ways you can reduce the occurrence of TLE with Python code
Use of PyPy3, which is a faster implementation of Python. Most competitive programming website has PyPy3 as a submission option. You do not need to change how you write the code, but usually implementations of PyPy3 do not implement libraries like numpy.
Avoid calling functions recursively - see this comment for an explanation and a workaround. I use a different workaround - I defined a function to call when I enter a node, and another function to call when I exit a node, and track the progress of the depth first search with a hashmap and stack. You can see how I implement it in the linked solution from Kick Start.
Avoid accessing list of lists. Probably you can use math and divmod to compute which indices should you access in the flattened matrix.
Libraries. C++ and Java has binary search trees built in, but not Python. I actually extracted a copy of the sortedcontainers library for use in contests.
Input output templates. I append input = sys.stdin.readline at the start of the code to read input faster. There is another template that is being used that is probably even faster."
"In what order should I do LeetCode problems?

Tong Hui Kang
Machine Learning Engineer in Recommendations

You want to work on a new problem if at least one of the following is true
The new problem has only one tag, and its difficulty is easy.
There was a previous problem you have done that contains all of the tags of the new problem, and the new problem has a difficulty of at most one higher than the original problem.
There was a previous problem you have done that contains all but one of the tags of the new problem, and the new problem is no more difficult than the previous problem.
Your objective is to find a feasible order to complete all the problems, or return that it is impossible.

"What does a competitive programmer resume look like?

Tong Hui Kang
Machine Learning Engineer in Recommendations
I do not think my competitive programmer “experience” was relevant in the decision on whether to offer me a job, but it did help me to get an interview. Companies recruit software engineers to build solutions, not ICPC teams to participate in World Finals.
Probably the competitive programmer should just list their Codeforces rating, and probably also one or two of their most significant contest achievement. This should not occupy much space.
I don’t think someone should have more than three lines on their contest experience - the Codeforces rating should already give a very good idea of the skill level to someone who knows competitive programming. The rest of the resume should describe work experience, education and projects instead.
For reference, this is mine.

Usually LeetCode contests do not have original problems, but since everyone solves it so quickly, you do not get an advantage from getting your solution from Google search.
The purpose of LeetCode contests for LeetCode, as now I understand it, is to crowdsource solutions from contest participants to benchmark their interview problems, and to maintain some community to discuss interview problems.

"What do Singaporeans think of Lawrence Wong?

Tong Hui Kang
Machine Learning Engineer in Recommendations
Lawrence Wong is now the designate for the Prime Minister of Singapore.
What most Singaporeans know about Lawrence Wong is how he handled Covid. For the past two years he has been trained to give press conferences almost daily, defending current policies and the changes to current policies. The policies include the initial decision to close borders, group-size restriction and relaxation, choice of vaccines, TraceTogether and SafeEntry, vaccination differentiation requirements, and most recently reopening of the cross-border travel with Malaysia. I believe has sufficient real-world training to take on the role of the Prime Minister of Singapore.

Gif source
Of course, I do disagree with some of the decisions. When Covid cases have risen to the thousands, I fail to see how TraceTogether and SafeEntry have not ceased to be useful tools for contact tracing. When most Singaporeans have received the second dose of the vaccines, I do not think most of the Covid restrictions make sense for vaccinated individuals. This copypasta was popular on r/singapore subreddit - and this might be indicative of populism and risk-averseness we will continue to see in policy making.
What are you talking about? We already have a very clear and unambiguous roadmap. We are well on track to Stage A of our very concrete and well thought out roadmap.
What are we opening up you ask? That is also very clearly laid out. We have done well, but there is more we need to do as we transition into a covid resilient nation. There are still many unknowns. We are studying what other countries are doing, and we will learn from their successes and mistakes, and also learn from our own successes and mistakes, and we will implement a plan to help us transition into a covid resilient nation that takes into account our unique situation. We need to be vigilant. We only got to where we are because of how hard we have worked, so we cannot squander what we have been given. We need to be #sgunited in order to reach our goal of being a covid resilient nation. The MMTF is keeping a close watch on the situation, and we will not hesitate to act when there is a need to. We know it has been a frustrating time for everyone, but we ask for your patience as we do all we can to make sure that Singapore transitions into a covid resilient nation.

Lee Hsien Loong has offered to Singapore his sudoku solver, usually insightful commentary on foreign policy, and the vision for a “smart nation”, I am not sure what Lawrence Wong is offering besides continuing the tradition of how Singapore is governed.
Ultimately, Lee Hsien Loong is not going to live forever and it is really time for Lee Hsien Loong to hand over the baton. Regardless, I am okay with a Prime Minister who can understand policy criticisms and defend policy decisions, with national interests at heart. That is all I am asking for, and it seems that Lawrence Wong has proven his ability in how he led the response to Covid."
"What is the biggest current threat to LeetCode?

Tong Hui Kang
Machine Learning Engineer in Recommendations
Not sure what the exact question that is being asked, I will answer regarding the threats faced by LeetCode as a business.
To an outside observer, it seems that LeetCode’s primary source of income is LeetCode premium subscription. The main benefit of subscription is that you can access premium questions, and statistics on the frequency of questions asked by companies. It appears that if someone manages to get all the questions from LeetCode and the information on frequency of the interviewed questions, there is no more value LeetCode has to its subscribers.
The list of questions from LeetCode has already been replicated in many places, although it seems that LeetCode is not invoking the copyright law as aggressively as CodeSignal. There are also many places where interview information is shared, such as in cscareers.dev, teamblind, and also on many other forums. These threats have already materialized, and LeetCode is still around, having new contests every week (some with merchandise as prizes) and updating the question bank.
LeetCode has since diversified from have only subscription revenue. They have a Chinese platform - which not only have the same information as the international version, but also they also have tools for interview and testing, with their large database of questions and benchmarked solutions.

"What are the problems with meritocracy?

Tong Hui Kang
Machine Learning Engineer in Recommendations
Let me share and break down this excellent article to answer this question.
https://www.todayonline.com/comm...
The author explores four critiques of meritocracy (Singapore’s version).
Meritocracy is problematic because meritocracy unfairly privileges those from higher socio-economic backgrounds.
Those from higher socio-economic backgrounds are being rewarded by the system not because they are genuinely more meritorious than those from lower socio-economic backgrounds, but simply because their parents have been able to provide conducive home environments or purchase tuition.

Meritocracy is problematic because the definition of merit is usually narrowly defined.
The ability to pass examinations is one of a range of valuable skills we want to hone and reward, and it is one that is not even particularly useful in the workplace.

Meritocracy is problematic because the rewards assigned with meritocracy is usually problematic. Children who score the best in examinations can enrol to an elite school. However, why do we even have elite schools? Is the fetishisation of elite schools good for society?
Take for instance admission into a small range of elite schools or the award of prestigious scholarships.
This criticism is concerned with the elitism that arises when we privilege a narrow range of rewards.

Meritocracy is problematic because meritocracy perpetuates the narrative that people are where they are because of their merit.
This national narrative, which is reproduced in the individual stories that Singaporeans tell themselves, is one of surmounting odds through hard work and skill.
Those who succeed are proclaimed as legitimately deserving. What is left implicit is that those at the bottom have failed to be deserving.
But this narrative fails to capture the multifaceted reasons why people may fail to succeed in Singapore’s system.
According to those who advance this critique, the real culprit is the dominance of the system which perpetuates the sense of inferiority among those who are unrewarded."

There are simple bots that you can use to moderate discussions.
Access to stickers. Messages are more interesting with words and emojis.
Large userbase and network effect. Since everyone is on Telegram, you have to be on Telegram to communicate with Singaporeans. Many news channels and government agencies, and even my Member of Parliament, has a Telegram channel.
Whatsapp is not preferred by young people now because
People may not want their contacts to be accessible by Facebook/Meta for their other products
Whatsapp, to their credit, is true end-to-end encryption. Unless you surrender your device and give them your password, in theory nobody else is not able to access your chats. However, this means that chat history is usually lost when you change devices. Most young people would rather keep the chat history by default.

"Is the L2 point of Earth in a permanent shadow of the Earth?

Tong Hui Kang
Machine Learning Engineer in Recommendations
L2 is a point in outer space where the James Webb Telescope will orbit around (in other words, it will not stay in the L2 point). I was curious how the Sun and Earth looks like from L2, so I have done some calculations.
The following data is collected from various pages in Wikipedia.
Distance of Sun from L2 - 150 million kilometers
Distance of Earth from L2 - 1.5 million kilometers
Diameter (equatorial) of Earth - 12,756 km
Diameter of Sun - 1,390,000 km
These are some calculations from the values above.
Diameter of Earth required to fully cover the Sun - 1/100 of 1,390,000 = 13,900 km
Ratio of diameters = (12,756 / 13,900) = 91.7%
Ratio of Sun covered = (12,756 / 13,900) ^ 2 = 84.2%

Stamp duty is the taxes paid to the government when buying or renting residential properties. For example, if you are buying property worth more than 100k, you need to pay a stamp duty on the price of the property, which may be between 1% to 24%.
https://singaporelegaladvice.com...

Stamp duty was projected to contribute 4.29 billion dollars of the total of 105 billion dollars of Singapore budget (which include a planned deficit of 10.5 billion). Significant, but not a lot.
The purpose of taxes is not to make Singapore government rich or “wealthy”, but to reallocate the resources to keep the country running. You can see how the money is spent - defense, education, health and transport.
Some money is stashed for investment purposes - we see that part of the income is generated by investment returns. Money is also needed to be stashed to respond to crises such as Covid - because of Covid, Singapore incurred a deficit of $64.9 billion in 2020.

"Being a country near to equator line, why sunglasses are not popular among Singaporeans?

Having just moved to California, now I understand why.
It is exactly because Singapore is near the equator.
The most practical reason of wearing sunglasses is when the sun is in your field of vision. This happens when are looking forward, you are looking at the sun. Sunglasses will help to reduce the glare.


When the sun is overhead, you are not looking at the sun. You do not need sunglasses. Even though the surrounding may be very bright, it does not impair your vision as much as someone shining a bright torch at you.
This is Singapore, which is near the equator. It is only in the evenings when the sun is in your field of vision, and only for a brief period of time - maybe an hour in the morning and in the evening.


This is California, which is in the Northern Hemisphere. For many hours in the day, the sun can be in your field of vision if you are looking at a certain direction.


Image source

Additional reasons include
Driving is the main mode of transport in the US, and it is easy to driver to carry along with them their sunglasses. You need to drive to get anywhere in the US. In Singapore, public transport is cheap and convenient.
Singapore is full of sheltered walkways, planted vegetation, and tall buildings, which blocks out sunlight.

A common bad habit of practicing on Leetcode is that people peek the solution, or even convince themselves that they understand the solution and copy and submit the solution. Make sure that you are not doing that.
It should also not be end of the practice when you get AC for your submission. You should look at the most upvoted solutions of your language and see how the code could be better written in terms of logic and readability. You should also refactor and improve your code if possible.
To better learn and integrate problems practiced, you need to identify patterns. There may be thousands and questions, but there are only a handful of patterns that is sufficient to tackle most coding interview questions.

I once did an online assessment question on expression evaluation that is harder than this. The problem redefined the order of operations and whether operations are executed from right to left instead of left to right.
https://binarysearch.com/problem...
For the coding interview however, there is little point in asking hard questions. Interviews should not be another online assessment where they watch you code yet another problem.

You need to summarize your work experience in around three statements. In the interview, be prepared to elaborate on each of the statements.

One piece of advice is to load each statement with metrics, but I did not do that because I could not do that for each of my internships. Moreover, I would prefer to keep statements in one line to make the resume look neater on an A4 paper.

"Does Singapore need to move away from the inflexible British-based education system and towards a more flexible system that emphasizes continuous testing?

Tong Hui Kang
Machine Learning Engineer in Recommendations
I presume the British-based education system refers to the O and A levels, in addition to PSLE. Singaporean students who prefer continuous testing may already opt for the IB curriculum at certain high schools.
In the Singapore education system, admission to primary schools, secondary schools, junior colleges and polytechnics almost completely depends on the final national exams. It is possible to have zero school attendance (with permission if possible) except during the national exams, and you get your placements in the desired course with the examination certificate. This means there is almost no continuous testing in mainstream Singapore schools.
There was already some forms of continuous testing in the current system. They are not popular.
Science Practical Assessment (or SPA) is carried out for science subjects in the O and A levels. This is done a few months before the national examinations, and not all students take the assessment at the same time, even if they are from the same school.
A level Project Work. Admittedly, it is a much-needed sample of group projects in the universities and the real world. However, how junior colleges administer the course vary in quality, tutors from the same junior college also vary in quality.
It is more difficult to standardise continuous assessment. Even for national examinations, the quality of teaching material produced already vary greatly among schools, even though they come from the same funding source. Fairness and meritocracy is an important principle in the Singapore education system, and many of us would prefer not to sacrifice any more of these.
The current approach to continuous assessment is to treat it as a low-risk low-stakes assessment where the impact on the final grades is limited as long as the student has done their homework.
I have no idea why continuous testing is more flexible than one with only final examinations. As long as the programme is regulated by an international institution, there are a syllabus to follow and deadlines to meet. Only universities and polytechnics with degree and diploma-granting powers have the flexibility to modify the courses."

However, there is this concept the white horse. White horse are children of influential families. If there is a difference in the treatment between recruits from different companies, recruits usually attribute the difference to the existence of a white horse. This is of course usually not proven."
"Why does the government of Singapore call visas ""passes""? It seems governments of other English-speaking countries (US, UK, Canada, Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, etc.) just call visas ""visas"".

It seems that there is some intention of the difference in nomenclature.

13. What is the difference between visa and visit pass?
Answer: Visitors must note that Singapore visa is not an immigration pass. It is a pre-entry permission for the holder of a valid Singapore visa to travel to, and seek entry, into Singapore. Possessing a valid visa does not guarantee entry into Singapore.

My interpretation is that visa is related to whether can you come into Singapore, and the type of pass is related to what can you do in Singapore.
Citizen of some countries can travel into Singapore visa-free, while citizens of other countries need to apply for a visa to Singapore and have it approved by Singapore.

However, even if you have a visa and managed to enter Singapore, the activities you can do in Singapore are limited. If you want to study, work or rent in Singapore, you need to apply for a pass. If you are coming in only as a tourist, you do not need a pass.

"What are the role and power of a Second Minister in Singapore? There are Second Ministers in many ministries besides the Minister.

This is the official and current list of ministers.
https://www.pmo.gov.sg/The-Cabinet
This is the Singapore Cabinet presented in another format, as of writing.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fi...
Beside Ministers, there are “Minister of State”, “Senior Minister of State”, “Parliamentary Secretary” and “Senior Parliamentary Secretary”. These elected politicians will assist the Minister in policy-making. The roles are also opportunities for the junior ministers to prove themselves before they lead the ministry.
It seems that all Second Ministers are already full Ministers in some ministry (which includes “Minister in the Prime Minister Office”). A second minister is probably not a training role. A second minister probably has the same power and responsibilities as the full minister. Ultimately, the Cabinet operates as a team and failure and successes are shared."
