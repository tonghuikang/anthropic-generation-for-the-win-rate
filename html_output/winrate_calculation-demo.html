The objective here is to fit a function f(caption) -&gt; image, by minimizing some loss function L(caption, image).<br>L(caption, image) is high when the image is unrelated to the caption, and L(caption, image) is low when the image is very related to the caption. The image generation model is trained to minimize L(caption, image).<br>However, L(caption, image) might be high for images with deformities, because L(caption, image) might only measure whether the image is related to the caption.<br>If you don’t penalize deformities in the training, you can’t generate images free-of-deformities.

Please READ carefully.<br>If a smog test was done on the vehicle recently, you should include the smog test certification in the Additional Related Documents, in case they ask for it. This may save you one email exchange.<br>You will also need to submit the Notice of Transfer and Release of Liability online. This lets DMV know that the seller is no longer responsible for parking/traffic violations or civil or criminal actions associated with the vehicle after the date of sale.<br>That is the easy part. You will receive an email with a case number where you can check the status of your case. Note that the page does not always load and you may need to refresh multiple times for the information to be displayed.<br>Now the hard part begins. You don’t know whether you have done the steps correctly. This is why I recommend spending a day in-person at the DMV or schedule a visit at the AAA branch instead, because the errors will be surfaced on the spot.<br>Additional documents might be requested. In my case, the Smog Certificate was requested.<br><br><br>I submitted my Smog Certificate by replying to the email they sent. After I submitted my Smog Certification, for quite some time I was unsure whether they have received my Smog Certificate. But if you look carefully in the screenshot, you see “Additional files were received with this case and are under review”, which is not obvious.<br>When they are satisfied with your softcopy documents, you will need to make a payment. Note there there is an additional 2% for using a credit or debit card. The alternative involves sending some account and routing numbers which could take days to execute, so I would rather pay the extra 2%.<br>After they have confirmed that they have received the payment, you will need to send the original title by mail. This is why I recommend that you use DMV Virtual Office if you know the seller well, because the title might get lost in the way.<br><br><br>I used USPS Priority Mail, which was around $10, to mail the original title. If you feel rich you could use Priority Mail Express, which is faster and costs $30. I sent my mail at a USPS Post Office. I needed to handwrite my full address and the DMV’s address on the USPS envelope and hope that the computer parses my handwriting correctly. The destination is apparently a mailbox (PO box) where DMV will retrieve the documents from once in a while.<br>USPS Priority Mail has tracking. It was recorded that the mail reached the PO box on Monday noon.

      <td id="T_a2d38_row11_col0" class="data row11 col0" >Should you fine-tune from a base model or an instruct model?<br><br>Tong Hui Kang<br>Machine Learning Engineer in Recommendations<br>Understand the definitions of pre-training, post-training, and fine-tuning.<br>- Pre-training is the stage where you take all the text from the Internet and train a next-token predictor. The output is a base model. Note that this base model is not useful for downstream applications (you can try to experience it yourself with OpenAI davinci-002).<br>- Post-training is the stage where you align the model to make coherent replies to user questions. There is a paper (Less is More for Alignment) that says 1000 examples in enough. I think the actual number should be in the millions. There are different methods to do post-training - SFT, RLHF, and DPO, just to name a few. We call the data used in post-training the post-training dataset. The output is an instruct model.<br>- Fine-tuning is the stage where you give the model a small amount of examples (50 to 100) so that the model produces responses in a style that you want. The output is a fine-tuned model.<br>There is a lot of work done in the post-training that you might want to inherit. Models fine-tuned from instruct models should know how to handle multi-turn conversations even though your fine-tuning dataset may consist of only single-turn responses. Models fine-tuned from instruct models inherit the safeguards that you might want for free. Models fine-tuned from instruct models inherit some ability to handle out-of-sample queries.<br>You need more examples to fine-tune from a base model. For the base models, OpenAI mentioned in 2022 that needed to “aim for at least ~500 examples”. For the instruct models OpenAI recommends “starting with 50 well-crafted demonstrations”. For instruct models, you can see that the model is imitating the style of your fine-tuning dataset with only 10 examples. For base models, you need many more examples before you can feel the difference between from base model you fine-tuned from. It is more encouraging to fine-tune from an instruct model where you can see progress with a little manual work, compared to fine-tuning from a base model.<br>OpenAI seems to prefer that you fine-tune from their instruct models. OpenAI’s current fine-tuning guide is focused on fine-tuning instruct models. I had to dig the archives for the statement that base models need at least 500 examples. OpenAI also considers its completion APIs as legacy.<br>The open-source community tends to prefer to fine-tune from base models. For most models, even the open-weights models, the post-training dataset is not published. You do not know exactly what the model is tuned to do or not to do. A base model is a compression of the Internet and is mostly unopinionated, whereas the post-training dataset is very opinionated on what should the intended response be.<br>The instruct model tends to be less creative than the base model. In May 2023, Andrej Karpathy shared that if he wanted a model that generates Pokemon names, he would use a base model to do that. The base model has lots of entropy and gives lots of diverse outputs.

      <td id="T_a2d38_row12_col0" class="data row12 col0" >Should you still include a prompt when fine-tuning?<br><br>Tong Hui Kang<br>Machine Learning Engineer in Recommendations<br>The point of fine-tuning is to avoid writing prompts. In OpenAI’s fine-tuning guide, fine-tuning is only recommended when it’s easier to “show, not tell”. This therefore raises the question on whether do we still need to include a prompt when fine-tuning.<br>However, I still suggest that you use a prompt and a concise one. For example, you want a solution that summarizes the content of the email in the title. A solution from pure prompt engineering would include long instructions on capitalization, what to focus on, and content length, for example. The prompt, when you do fine-tuning, should be just “Summarize the content of the email as a title”.<br>There is this idea that it is easier to learn from the mistakes that you make, compared to the mistakes that someone else has made. It also means that it is easier to repeat what you could have done rather than what someone else could have done. It is more likely for the pre-fine-tuned model to arrive at your intended email titles if you include a concise prompt. I have not studied the research backing up this idea here.<br>However, with more input tokens, it will cost more in terms of compute, and therefore more money.<br>I don’t think you should include any more than the minimum context here. I expect that the model will learn style from your fine-tuning dataset, and having very detailed prompts might detract from that objective. Again, I have not studied the research backing up this idea here.<br>Note that if you include a prompt in the fine-tuning dataset, you need to make sure you include the same prompt in production in the same exact format.</td>

      <td id="T_a2d38_row13_col0" class="data row13 col0" >Should you fine-tune an LLM, or just do prompt engineering?<br><br>Tong Hui Kang<br>Machine Learning Engineer in Recommendations<br>You should always start with the simplest solution. The simplest solution is prompt engineering. See these arguments for simplicity. By shipping, you get to see what prompt engineering can achieve. You also have access to data that could be used to fine-tune your model.<br>Fine-tuned models may be cheaper for the same performance. There are claims where you can achieve GPT-4 performance with a 7B model which can be served for cheap. However, the benchmark you need to beat now is Claude-3-Haiku, which is $0.25/$1.25. General-purpose LLMs are only getting cheaper over time, whereas the cost to serve your fine-tuned model is the same. General-purpose LLMs are easier to serve at scale because they can batch multiple requests.<br>You should also consider the cost of shipping a solution with fine-tuning. You need to think of how much you are getting paid. If you spend one engineer-month to fine-tune something to reduce a yearly cost of $500 to $200, are you really saving costs?<br>Fine-tuning may not solve your problem if prompt engineering can’t. If you cannot prompt engineer your way to generate a good response at least 10% of the time, fine-tuning will not save you. Fine-tuning only changes the style of the response. Fine-tuning does not increase the capabilities of the model or truly give the model new knowledge.<br>Try squeezing performance out of prompt engineering and function calling first. You might be not correctly doing prompt engineering. You can provide feedback to general-purpose LLM. If you want to build a chatbot that writes a certain flavor of SQL, just execute the SQL and provide the error feedback to the chatbot. General-purpose LLMs may just adopt the feedback pretty well.<br>There are many pitfalls that come along with fine-tuning. For prompt engineering, it is obvious if it works. If it does not work, change the prompt. For fine-tuning, if it does not work, it is not easy for a beginner to know what went wrong. There are many places where it could go wrong.<br>Collecting a fine-tuning dataset is hard. Collecting a good fine-tuning dataset is not easy If writing a 100-word prompt is hard, collecting a 100-example fine-tuning dataset is even harder.<br>It is possible that prompt engineering is harder than fine-tuning. In cases where it is easier to show rather than tell, fine-tuning makes more sense. It might be easier to collect and show 100 or 1000 examples than to write lengthy instructions for the model. An example of this use case is to generate interview questions based on the interviewee’s background. It is really hard to put down in words the qualities of a good question. Few-shot prompts may not work because they do not fully describe what you want. You will need to change the prompt when you change the model. Each model has their idiosyncrasies that you might need to specifically prompt against. New models are better and cheaper and old proprietary models will be deprecated. If you have a good fine-tuning dataset, you could probably just use the same dataset.<br>You might need a fine-tuning dataset anyway. If you making serious LLM applications, you need evaluation even if you are only doing prompt engineering. The fine-tuning dataset can be repurposed into an evaluation dataset.<br>It depends on the current state of the art. It depends on whether are there powerful models available to fine-tune. It depends on whether the performance of general-purpose models is much better than the models available to fine-tune. It depends on whether there are used platforms for fine-tuning. It depends on whether are there easy-to-use platforms for prompt engineering. It depends on the prices of calling general-purpose models versus deployed fine-tuned models.<br>You just need to do fine-tuning anyway. You might just need to write a paper on how fine-tuning a certain dataset can “achieve a performance better than GPT-4” on a certain specific task. Or your client is paying you money and they do not appreciate a 100-word well-written prompt with rigorous evaluations. You want to build capability for your organization, or you want to tick certain checkboxes for yourself. It is still good for the company if there are a few people who know the nature of fine-tuning. Instead of regarding fine-tuning as a cure-all solution only if you had more staffing, it is good to know what are you missing (or what are you not missing). If this is the actual reason to fine-tune, you need to be aware and be honest.</td>

I don’t oppose such a charge now, and now I see there is some merit to it. However, I still don’t think we should have strong opinions against both options.<br>Currently at where I live in California, there is a plastic bag charge of 10 cents per bag. People here just seem to accept the fact and honestly declare at the self-checkout counter in the grocery store on how many store-provided bags do they use. I pretty much have accepted the fact too - but that was mainly because there are other facts I still couldn’t accept.<br>I also visited Taipei once, they also impose a similar plastic bag charge. Interestingly, that plastic bags in Taipei have a fancy hologram label.<br>https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyi...<br>The plastic bag charge did change my behavior in California.<br>If I am buying only a few items I do not request for a plastic bag. For some items like a carton of eggs, I would have definitely requested for a plastic bag if there was not a charge, but now I would only request a bag only if I am buying more items. I will take the risk of having my eggs broken.<br>If I am buying many things from a grocery store, my housemate and I will try to remember to bring some plastic bags. There might be some plastic bags stored in the car that I use, but I am not too sure about that right now. (Of course, you should not keep to many visible things in your car to reduce the chances of getting your window smashed.)<br>I don’t see the point of driving to my house to get plastic bags if I forgot to have them in the car. The additional mileage and risk taken is not worth it, neither it is environmentally friendly. I see the plastic bag charge as a penalty for forgetting to bring a plastic bag.<br>I do not use a wastepaper basket for our trash can. When I was raised in Singapore we had been using a wastepaper basket for the entire house of four. The 3-gallon wastepaper basket sized trash can is lined with a 3-gallon plastic bag from the grocery store. When the trash can is full, we wrap it and throw it down the rubbish chute. On hindsight, this is quite an inefficient process because every time the trash is full, someone in the house needs to bend their back, tie the bag and throw it down the chute. Currently where I live in California, we have a 13 gallon trash can and a 13 gallon trash bag which costs $9 for 45 bags (20 cents per bag). We bag our trash and throw it probably once a week, we should have done this in Singapore too.<br>Of course, in Singapore you can express you frustration at the ballot box. However, please note that the Worker’s Party also called for the introduction of a single-use plastic charge.</td>

You can choose to put in the bare minimum effort for your projects and examinations, or you can choose to get to the top of the class. You can choose to complete just one unremarkable internship to fulfill graduation requirements, or you can choose to hustle and grind for the most coveted internships.<br>This is what I summarize as the main differences between SUTD and NUS/NTU<br>The first year in SUTD is held in the classroom, which mean you will interact with the same classmates for all courses for two or three semesters.<br>The first year in SUTD is common. The classmates you work with in the first year may not get the same degree with you i.e. “interdisciplinary experience”.<br>Most courses have group projects.<br>The cohort size of SUTD is small (still around 400 to 500).<br>If you are aiming for the top grades, doing well by yourself alone is not sufficient. As SUTD has more course projects, you need to get your project group mates to contribute. It is also not feasible to do all the work for your course projects. This could contribute to stress.<br>You are more likely to have more friends and acquaintances from the first year you spend together in SUTD. This might contribute to less stress. Or more.<br>As SUTD is an engineering-focused university with an unsurprising gender ratio, if you are a heterosexual male looking for a traditional relationship, you might feel more stress. Or less, if you do not care about a relationship.<br>As the cohort size is small, there is less flexibility for the curriculum. Most required classes are only held once per year. If you fail the course, you usually could only retake the course in one year later. This might give significant pressure if you are failing the course. This could contribute to stress.<br>There is less awareness of how high the ceiling is, because of the small cohort size. Throughout my years, I am not aware of anyone in my cohort who scored a Bay Area internship, or interned at Google and Facebook in Singapore. I thought that was simply impossible. There are people who did that in NUS (probably not as often in NTU), see Reddit thread for reference.

If so, where do they buy them from?<br><br>Tong Hui Kang<br>Machine Learning Engineer in Recommendations<br>Actually an interesting question.<br>In Primary school (Year 1–6) and Lower Secondary school (Year 7–8), we have a booklist that is produced by the school. It looks something like this. [1]<br><br><br>As mentioned in the booklist, you can buy the books in the school bookshop. Apparently, some books are cheaper in a nationwide bookstore Popular bookstore compared to the school bookshop, and parents might save a few dollars buying from there. Probably I might not had paid attention, I did not remember anyone reusing a textbook, other than one possibly from their elder sibling. There are donation drives [3] where you can donate and collect textbooks.<br>You see that there are textbooks and activity books. Lessons are conducted with the textbook. Homework is written in the activity book. When the homework is due, the activity book is passed to the teacher, who will mark the homework and return the activity book in the next lesson or two.<br>For Upper Secondary school (Year 9–10) and Junior College (Year 11–12), there are no longer activity books (at least in the secondary school that I have studied in).<br><br><br>The studies in Upper Secondary is geared towards preparation for the national examinations, such as the O levels. There are no longer activity books that you need to submit, but there is still (a lot of) homework. Homework is now printed in A4 paper, and you write your solutions on the paper or on additional foolscap papers. Students might need to pay for printing.<br>There might not be a market for Upper Secondary activity books because teachers want to decide exactly what questions should the students work on for homework. The student cohorts in different classes or different schools can vary significantly in their academic ability, and it is hard to craft a one-size-fits-all problem set.<br>For math and science subjects, you see that there is also these topical books. It is a required purchase, even though I don’t remember opening these books at all. The questions found in the A4-printed homework are actually from these topical books. The school requires the students to buy these books to protect the school from copyright lawsuits.<br>Students will also need to buy the Ten Year Series (TYS). The TYS contains the questions from the national examinations from the past ten years, and will be heavily used closer to the dates of the national examinations. Again, this is a required purchase to protect the school from lawsuits. A class representative will be collecting the money from everyone in the class.<br>In Junior College, we do not have textbooks anymore. The content is mostly delivered the slides, which will be uploaded into school learning management portal. Students are still required to buy books with the problem statements and Ten Year Series (or Thirty Year Series) for the same reason.<br>[1] Anglo-Chinese School Booklist<br>[2] Anderson Secondary School Booklist<br>[3] S&#x27;pore public urged to donate another 150,000 pre-loved textbooks to hit 500,000 target</td>

Most competitive programming website has PyPy3 as a submission option. You do not need to change how you write the code, but usually implementations of PyPy3 do not implement libraries like numpy.<br>Avoid calling functions recursively - see this comment for an explanation and a workaround. I use a different workaround - I defined a function to call when I enter a node, and another function to call when I exit a node, and track the progress of the depth first search with a hashmap and stack. You can see how I implement it in the linked solution from Kick Start.<br>Avoid accessing list of lists. Probably you can use math and divmod to compute which indices should you access in the flattened matrix.<br>Libraries. C++ and Java has binary search trees built in, but not Python.

For the past two years he has been trained to give press conferences almost daily, defending current policies and the changes to current policies. The policies include the initial decision to close borders, group-size restriction and relaxation, choice of vaccines, TraceTogether and SafeEntry, vaccination differentiation requirements, and most recently reopening of the cross-border travel with Malaysia.

That is also very clearly laid out. We have done well, but there is more we need to do as we transition into a covid resilient nation. There are still many unknowns. We are studying what other countries are doing, and we will learn from their successes and mistakes, and also learn from our own successes and mistakes, and we will implement a plan to help us transition into a covid resilient nation that takes into account our unique situation. We need to be vigilant. We only got to where we are because of how hard we have worked, so we cannot squander what we have been given. We need to be #sgunited in order to reach our goal of being a covid resilient nation. The MMTF is keeping a close watch on the situation, and we will not hesitate to act when there is a need to. We know it has been a frustrating time for everyone, but we ask for your patience as we do all we can to make sure that Singapore transitions into a covid resilient nation.<br><br>Lee Hsien Loong has offered to Singapore his sudoku solver, usually insightful commentary on foreign policy, and the vision for a “smart nation”, I am not sure what Lawrence Wong is offering besides continuing the tradition of how Singapore is governed.<br>Ultimately, Lee Hsien Loong is not going to live forever and it is really time for Lee Hsien Loong to hand over the baton.

Children who score the best in examinations can enrol to an elite school. However, why do we even have elite schools? Is the fetishisation of elite schools good for society?<br>Take for instance admission into a small range of elite schools or the award of prestigious scholarships.<br>This criticism is concerned with the elitism that arises when we privilege a narrow range of rewards.<br><br>Meritocracy is problematic because meritocracy perpetuates the narrative that people are where they are because of their merit.<br>This national narrative, which is reproduced in the individual stories that Singaporeans tell themselves, is one of surmounting odds through hard work and skill.<br>Those who succeed are proclaimed as legitimately deserving. What is left implicit is that those at the bottom have failed to be deserving.<br>But this narrative fails to capture the multifaceted reasons why people may fail to succeed in Singapore’s system.<br>According to those who advance this critique, the real culprit is the dominance of the system which perpetuates the sense of inferiority among those who are unrewarded.</td>

Singaporean students who prefer continuous testing may already opt for the IB curriculum at certain high schools.<br>In the Singapore education system, admission to primary schools, secondary schools, junior colleges and polytechnics almost completely depends on the final national exams. It is possible to have zero school attendance (with permission if possible) except during the national exams, and you get your placements in the desired course with the examination certificate. This means there is almost no continuous testing in mainstream Singapore schools.<br>There was already some forms of continuous testing in the current system. They are not popular.<br>Science Practical Assessment (or SPA) is carried out for science subjects in the O and A levels. This is done a few months before the national examinations, and not all students take the assessment at the same time, even if they are from the same school.<br>A level Project Work. Admittedly, it is a much-needed sample of group projects in the universities and the real world. However, how junior colleges administer the course vary in quality, tutors from the same junior college also vary in quality.<br>It is more difficult to standardise continuous assessment. Even for national examinations, the quality of teaching material produced already vary greatly among schools, even though they come from the same funding source. Fairness and meritocracy is an important principle in the Singapore education system, and many of us would prefer not to sacrifice any more of these.<br>The current approach to continuous assessment is to treat it as a low-risk low-stakes assessment where the impact on the final grades is limited as long as the student has done their homework.<br>I have no idea why continuous testing is more flexible than one with only final examinations. As long as the programme is regulated by an international institution, there are a syllabus to follow and deadlines to meet.
