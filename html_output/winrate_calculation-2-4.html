Children who score the best in examinations can enrol to an elite school. However, why do we even have elite schools? Is the fetishisation of elite schools good for society?<br>Take for instance admission into a small range of elite schools or the award of prestigious scholarships.<br>This criticism is concerned with the elitism that arises when we privilege a narrow range of rewards.<br><br>Meritocracy is problematic because meritocracy perpetuates the narrative that people are where they are because of their merit.<br>This national narrative, which is reproduced in the individual stories that Singaporeans tell themselves, is one of surmounting odds through hard work and skill.<br>Those who succeed are proclaimed as legitimately deserving. What is left implicit is that those at the bottom have failed to be deserving.<br>But this narrative fails to capture the multifaceted reasons why people may fail to succeed in Singapore’s system.<br>According to those who advance this critique, the real culprit is the dominance of the system which perpetuates the sense of inferiority among those who are unrewarded.</td>

Singaporean students who prefer continuous testing may already opt for the IB curriculum at certain high schools.<br>In the Singapore education system, admission to primary schools, secondary schools, junior colleges and polytechnics almost completely depends on the final national exams. It is possible to have zero school attendance (with permission if possible) except during the national exams, and you get your placements in the desired course with the examination certificate. This means there is almost no continuous testing in mainstream Singapore schools.<br>There was already some forms of continuous testing in the current system. They are not popular.<br>Science Practical Assessment (or SPA) is carried out for science subjects in the O and A levels. This is done a few months before the national examinations, and not all students take the assessment at the same time, even if they are from the same school.<br>A level Project Work. Admittedly, it is a much-needed sample of group projects in the universities and the real world. However, how junior colleges administer the course vary in quality, tutors from the same junior college also vary in quality.<br>It is more difficult to standardise continuous assessment. Even for national examinations, the quality of teaching material produced already vary greatly among schools, even though they come from the same funding source. Fairness and meritocracy is an important principle in the Singapore education system, and many of us would prefer not to sacrifice any more of these.<br>The current approach to continuous assessment is to treat it as a low-risk low-stakes assessment where the impact on the final grades is limited as long as the student has done their homework.<br>I have no idea why continuous testing is more flexible than one with only final examinations. As long as the programme is regulated by an international institution, there are a syllabus to follow and deadlines to meet.

      <td id="T_dc3e0_row18_col0" class="data row18 col0" >Should you still include a prompt when fine-tuning?<br><br>Tong Hui Kang<br>Machine Learning Engineer in Recommendations<br>The point of fine-tuning is to avoid writing prompts. In OpenAI’s fine-tuning guide, fine-tuning is only recommended when it’s easier to “show, not tell”. This therefore raises the question on whether do we still need to include a prompt when fine-tuning.<br>However, I still suggest that you use a prompt and a concise one. For example, you want a solution that summarizes the content of the email in the title. A solution from pure prompt engineering would include long instructions on capitalization, what to focus on, and content length, for example. The prompt, when you do fine-tuning, should be just “Summarize the content of the email as a title”.<br>There is this idea that it is easier to learn from the mistakes that you make, compared to the mistakes that someone else has made. It also means that it is easier to repeat what you could have done rather than what someone else could have done. It is more likely for the pre-fine-tuned model to arrive at your intended email titles if you include a concise prompt. I have not studied the research backing up this idea here.<br>However, with more input tokens, it will cost more in terms of compute, and therefore more money.<br>I don’t think you should include any more than the minimum context here. I expect that the model will learn style from your fine-tuning dataset, and having very detailed prompts might detract from that objective. Again, I have not studied the research backing up this idea here.<br>Note that if you include a prompt in the fine-tuning dataset, you need to make sure you include the same prompt in production in the same exact format.</td>

      <td id="T_dc3e0_row19_col0" class="data row19 col0" >Should you fine-tune an LLM, or just do prompt engineering?<br><br>Tong Hui Kang<br>Machine Learning Engineer in Recommendations<br>You should always start with the simplest solution. The simplest solution is prompt engineering. See these arguments for simplicity. By shipping, you get to see what prompt engineering can achieve. You also have access to data that could be used to fine-tune your model.<br>Fine-tuned models may be cheaper for the same performance. There are claims where you can achieve GPT-4 performance with a 7B model which can be served for cheap. However, the benchmark you need to beat now is Claude-3-Haiku, which is $0.25/$1.25. General-purpose LLMs are only getting cheaper over time, whereas the cost to serve your fine-tuned model is the same. General-purpose LLMs are easier to serve at scale because they can batch multiple requests.<br>You should also consider the cost of shipping a solution with fine-tuning. You need to think of how much you are getting paid. If you spend one engineer-month to fine-tune something to reduce a yearly cost of $500 to $200, are you really saving costs?<br>Fine-tuning may not solve your problem if prompt engineering can’t. If you cannot prompt engineer your way to generate a good response at least 10% of the time, fine-tuning will not save you. Fine-tuning only changes the style of the response. Fine-tuning does not increase the capabilities of the model or truly give the model new knowledge.<br>Try squeezing performance out of prompt engineering and function calling first. You might be not correctly doing prompt engineering. You can provide feedback to general-purpose LLM. If you want to build a chatbot that writes a certain flavor of SQL, just execute the SQL and provide the error feedback to the chatbot. General-purpose LLMs may just adopt the feedback pretty well.<br>There are many pitfalls that come along with fine-tuning. For prompt engineering, it is obvious if it works. If it does not work, change the prompt. For fine-tuning, if it does not work, it is not easy for a beginner to know what went wrong. There are many places where it could go wrong.<br>Collecting a fine-tuning dataset is hard. Collecting a good fine-tuning dataset is not easy If writing a 100-word prompt is hard, collecting a 100-example fine-tuning dataset is even harder.<br>It is possible that prompt engineering is harder than fine-tuning. In cases where it is easier to show rather than tell, fine-tuning makes more sense. It might be easier to collect and show 100 or 1000 examples than to write lengthy instructions for the model. An example of this use case is to generate interview questions based on the interviewee’s background. It is really hard to put down in words the qualities of a good question. Few-shot prompts may not work because they do not fully describe what you want. You will need to change the prompt when you change the model. Each model has their idiosyncrasies that you might need to specifically prompt against. New models are better and cheaper and old proprietary models will be deprecated. If you have a good fine-tuning dataset, you could probably just use the same dataset.<br>You might need a fine-tuning dataset anyway. If you making serious LLM applications, you need evaluation even if you are only doing prompt engineering. The fine-tuning dataset can be repurposed into an evaluation dataset.<br>It depends on the current state of the art. It depends on whether are there powerful models available to fine-tune. It depends on whether the performance of general-purpose models is much better than the models available to fine-tune. It depends on whether there are used platforms for fine-tuning. It depends on whether are there easy-to-use platforms for prompt engineering. It depends on the prices of calling general-purpose models versus deployed fine-tuned models.<br>You just need to do fine-tuning anyway. You might just need to write a paper on how fine-tuning a certain dataset can “achieve a performance better than GPT-4” on a certain specific task. Or your client is paying you money and they do not appreciate a 100-word well-written prompt with rigorous evaluations. You want to build capability for your organization, or you want to tick certain checkboxes for yourself. It is still good for the company if there are a few people who know the nature of fine-tuning. Instead of regarding fine-tuning as a cure-all solution only if you had more staffing, it is good to know what are you missing (or what are you not missing). If this is the actual reason to fine-tune, you need to be aware and be honest.</td>
