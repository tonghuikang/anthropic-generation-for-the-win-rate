      <td id="T_ef27c_row9_col0" class="data row9 col0" >Do Singaporean students buy their textbooks? If so, where do they buy them from?<br><br>Tong Hui Kang<br>Machine Learning Engineer in Recommendations<br>Actually an interesting question.<br>In Primary school (Year 1–6) and Lower Secondary school (Year 7–8), we have a booklist that is produced by the school. It looks something like this. [1]<br><br><br>As mentioned in the booklist, you can buy the books in the school bookshop. Apparently, some books are cheaper in a nationwide bookstore Popular bookstore compared to the school bookshop, and parents might save a few dollars buying from there. Probably I might not had paid attention, I did not remember anyone reusing a textbook, other than one possibly from their elder sibling. There are donation drives [3] where you can donate and collect textbooks.<br>You see that there are textbooks and activity books. Lessons are conducted with the textbook. Homework is written in the activity book. When the homework is due, the activity book is passed to the teacher, who will mark the homework and return the activity book in the next lesson or two.<br>For Upper Secondary school (Year 9–10) and Junior College (Year 11–12), there are no longer activity books (at least in the secondary school that I have studied in).<br><br><br>The studies in Upper Secondary is geared towards preparation for the national examinations, such as the O levels. There are no longer activity books that you need to submit, but there is still (a lot of) homework. Homework is now printed in A4 paper, and you write your solutions on the paper or on additional foolscap papers. Students might need to pay for printing.<br>There might not be a market for Upper Secondary activity books because teachers want to decide exactly what questions should the students work on for homework. The student cohorts in different classes or different schools can vary significantly in their academic ability, and it is hard to craft a one-size-fits-all problem set.<br>For math and science subjects, you see that there is also these topical books. It is a required purchase, even though I don’t remember opening these books at all. The questions found in the A4-printed homework are actually from these topical books. The school requires the students to buy these books to protect the school from copyright lawsuits.<br>Students will also need to buy the Ten Year Series (TYS). The TYS contains the questions from the national examinations from the past ten years, and will be heavily used closer to the dates of the national examinations. Again, this is a required purchase to protect the school from lawsuits. A class representative will be collecting the money from everyone in the class.<br>In Junior College, we do not have textbooks anymore. The content is mostly delivered the slides, which will be uploaded into school learning management portal. Students are still required to buy books with the problem statements and Ten Year Series (or Thirty Year Series) for the same reason.<br>[1] Anglo-Chinese School Booklist<br>[2] Anderson Secondary School Booklist<br>[3] S&#x27;pore public urged to donate another 150,000 pre-loved textbooks to hit 500,000 target</td>

The main benefit of subscription is that you can access premium questions, and statistics on the frequency of questions asked by companies. It appears that if someone manages to get all the questions from LeetCode and the information on frequency of the interviewed questions, there is no more value LeetCode has to its subscribers.<br>The list of questions from LeetCode has already been replicated in many places, although it seems that LeetCode is not invoking the copyright law as aggressively as CodeSignal. There are also many places where interview information is shared, such as in cscareers.dev, teamblind, and also on many other forums. These threats have already materialized, and LeetCode is still around, having new contests every week (some with merchandise as prizes) and updating the question bank.<br>LeetCode has since diversified from have only subscription revenue. They have a Chinese platform - which not only have the same information as the international version, but also they also have tools for interview and testing, with their large database of questions and benchmarked solutions.<br>https://e.leetcode-cn.com/<br>Probably their biggest threat now is to be profitable in the long run with their diversification - I don’t have statistics on the amount of revenue they are getting from each source, relative to their expenditure.</td>

I recommend against making your own template unless it is better than these templates.<br>Resumes are usually automatically parsed to extract keywords, and the resume template presented above are accurately parsed by one resume parser.<br>With the formatting out of the way, you can now focus on the language. Where you worked and where you studied are facts that you cannot change or sugarcoat. You could only optimize the description of your experience in the companies. This is where you should put most of your thoughts on.<br>This is the resume that got me two offers, without brand-name companies in my experience.<br><br><br>You need to summarize your work experience in around three statements. In the interview, be prepared to elaborate on each of the statements.<br>How you want to craft your line depends on your preferences and experience. One piece of advice is to load each statement with metrics, but I did not do that because I could not do that for each of my internships. Moreover, I would prefer to keep statements in one line to make the resume look neater on an A4 paper.<br>TL;DR - use the templates, and worry only about how to describe your experience.</td>

Many of them know how to use Python but rarely use it.<br>On Codeforces, I follow Codeforces grandmasters who frequently use Python for more than half of their submissions.<br>conqueror_of_tourist is currently the highest rated Python programmer at 2737. He was the first Python grandmaster. If I traced his identity correctly, he is Dilhan Salgado who represented Carnegie Mellon University for ICPC and Putnam.<br>https://codeforces.com/profile/c...<br>pajenegod was almost the first Python grandmaster but the contest that would have made him grandmaster was unrated. He is currently not very active on Codeforces contests, but still often comment on posts related to Python. pajenegod has been a major contributor to PyRival, a collection of Python algorithm templates.<br>https://codeforces.com/profile/p...<br>Kiri8128 was the first Python grandmaster who only use Python in their submissions. On the other hand, conqueror_of_tourist and pajenegod often switch to C++ when they suspect that the time limit is tight and any Python solution is not likely to pass.<br>https://codeforces.com/profile/K...</td>
