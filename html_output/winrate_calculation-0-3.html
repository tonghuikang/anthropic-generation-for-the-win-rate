If so, where do they buy them from?<br><br>Tong Hui Kang<br>Machine Learning Engineer in Recommendations<br>Actually an interesting question.<br>In Primary school (Year 1–6) and Lower Secondary school (Year 7–8), we have a booklist that is produced by the school. It looks something like this. [1]<br><br><br>As mentioned in the booklist, you can buy the books in the school bookshop. Apparently, some books are cheaper in a nationwide bookstore Popular bookstore compared to the school bookshop, and parents might save a few dollars buying from there. Probably I might not had paid attention, I did not remember anyone reusing a textbook, other than one possibly from their elder sibling. There are donation drives [3] where you can donate and collect textbooks.<br>You see that there are textbooks and activity books. Lessons are conducted with the textbook. Homework is written in the activity book. When the homework is due, the activity book is passed to the teacher, who will mark the homework and return the activity book in the next lesson or two.<br>For Upper Secondary school (Year 9–10) and Junior College (Year 11–12), there are no longer activity books (at least in the secondary school that I have studied in).<br><br><br>The studies in Upper Secondary is geared towards preparation for the national examinations, such as the O levels. There are no longer activity books that you need to submit, but there is still (a lot of) homework. Homework is now printed in A4 paper, and you write your solutions on the paper or on additional foolscap papers. Students might need to pay for printing.<br>There might not be a market for Upper Secondary activity books because teachers want to decide exactly what questions should the students work on for homework. The student cohorts in different classes or different schools can vary significantly in their academic ability, and it is hard to craft a one-size-fits-all problem set.<br>For math and science subjects, you see that there is also these topical books. It is a required purchase, even though I don’t remember opening these books at all. The questions found in the A4-printed homework are actually from these topical books. The school requires the students to buy these books to protect the school from copyright lawsuits.<br>Students will also need to buy the Ten Year Series (TYS). The TYS contains the questions from the national examinations from the past ten years, and will be heavily used closer to the dates of the national examinations. Again, this is a required purchase to protect the school from lawsuits. A class representative will be collecting the money from everyone in the class.<br>In Junior College, we do not have textbooks anymore. The content is mostly delivered the slides, which will be uploaded into school learning management portal. Students are still required to buy books with the problem statements and Ten Year Series (or Thirty Year Series) for the same reason.<br>[1] Anglo-Chinese School Booklist<br>[2] Anderson Secondary School Booklist<br>[3] S&#x27;pore public urged to donate another 150,000 pre-loved textbooks to hit 500,000 target</td>

One piece of advice is to load each statement with metrics, but I did not do that because I could not do that for each of my internships. Moreover, I would prefer to keep statements in one line to make the resume look neater on an A4 paper.<br>TL;DR - use the templates, and worry only about how to describe your experience.</td>
