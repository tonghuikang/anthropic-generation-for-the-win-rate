Singaporean students who prefer continuous testing may already opt for the IB curriculum at certain high schools.<br>In the Singapore education system, admission to primary schools, secondary schools, junior colleges and polytechnics almost completely depends on the final national exams. It is possible to have zero school attendance (with permission if possible) except during the national exams, and you get your placements in the desired course with the examination certificate. This means there is almost no continuous testing in mainstream Singapore schools.<br>There was already some forms of continuous testing in the current system. They are not popular.<br>Science Practical Assessment (or SPA) is carried out for science subjects in the O and A levels. This is done a few months before the national examinations, and not all students take the assessment at the same time, even if they are from the same school.<br>A level Project Work. Admittedly, it is a much-needed sample of group projects in the universities and the real world. However, how junior colleges administer the course vary in quality, tutors from the same junior college also vary in quality.<br>It is more difficult to standardise continuous assessment. Even for national examinations, the quality of teaching material produced already vary greatly among schools, even though they come from the same funding source. Fairness and meritocracy is an important principle in the Singapore education system, and many of us would prefer not to sacrifice any more of these.<br>The current approach to continuous assessment is to treat it as a low-risk low-stakes assessment where the impact on the final grades is limited as long as the student has done their homework.<br>I have no idea why continuous testing is more flexible than one with only final examinations. As long as the programme is regulated by an international institution, there are a syllabus to follow and deadlines to meet. Only universities and polytechnics with degree and diploma-granting powers have the flexibility to modify the courses.</td>

      <td id="T_9c00d_row17_col0" class="data row17 col0" >Should you fine-tune from a base model or an instruct model?<br><br>Tong Hui Kang<br>Machine Learning Engineer in Recommendations<br>Understand the definitions of pre-training, post-training, and fine-tuning.<br>- Pre-training is the stage where you take all the text from the Internet and train a next-token predictor. The output is a base model. Note that this base model is not useful for downstream applications (you can try to experience it yourself with OpenAI davinci-002).<br>- Post-training is the stage where you align the model to make coherent replies to user questions. There is a paper (Less is More for Alignment) that says 1000 examples in enough. I think the actual number should be in the millions. There are different methods to do post-training - SFT, RLHF, and DPO, just to name a few. We call the data used in post-training the post-training dataset. The output is an instruct model.<br>- Fine-tuning is the stage where you give the model a small amount of examples (50 to 100) so that the model produces responses in a style that you want. The output is a fine-tuned model.<br>There is a lot of work done in the post-training that you might want to inherit. Models fine-tuned from instruct models should know how to handle multi-turn conversations even though your fine-tuning dataset may consist of only single-turn responses. Models fine-tuned from instruct models inherit the safeguards that you might want for free. Models fine-tuned from instruct models inherit some ability to handle out-of-sample queries.<br>You need more examples to fine-tune from a base model. For the base models, OpenAI mentioned in 2022 that needed to “aim for at least ~500 examples”. For the instruct models OpenAI recommends “starting with 50 well-crafted demonstrations”. For instruct models, you can see that the model is imitating the style of your fine-tuning dataset with only 10 examples. For base models, you need many more examples before you can feel the difference between from base model you fine-tuned from. It is more encouraging to fine-tune from an instruct model where you can see progress with a little manual work, compared to fine-tuning from a base model.<br>OpenAI seems to prefer that you fine-tune from their instruct models. OpenAI’s current fine-tuning guide is focused on fine-tuning instruct models. I had to dig the archives for the statement that base models need at least 500 examples. OpenAI also considers its completion APIs as legacy.<br>The open-source community tends to prefer to fine-tune from base models. For most models, even the open-weights models, the post-training dataset is not published. You do not know exactly what the model is tuned to do or not to do. A base model is a compression of the Internet and is mostly unopinionated, whereas the post-training dataset is very opinionated on what should the intended response be.<br>The instruct model tends to be less creative than the base model. In May 2023, Andrej Karpathy shared that if he wanted a model that generates Pokemon names, he would use a base model to do that. The base model has lots of entropy and gives lots of diverse outputs. Therefore, if you want to generate more diverse outputs, you might want to fine-tune from the base model.</td>

I tried gpt2-chatbot to solve the set of 10 sample problems the competition organizer has published and these are the results. It got 4 out of 10 correct at zero-shot (zero prompting involved, I only used the question statement only).<br>https://www.kaggle.com/competiti...<br>I like how it does step-by-step reasoning in a manner not seen in the current models. The issue with the low-tier models is that they produce responses that look good but are actually obviously wrong. “gpt2-chatbot” does not pretend that they have an answer every time.<br>The model still produces obviously wrong output though, like giving numbers that are obviously not a geometric sequence to the question “There exists a unique increasing geometric sequence of five 2-digit positive integers. What is their sum?”<br>With better prompting and tool use, I think the model could solve all of the sample problems.</td>
