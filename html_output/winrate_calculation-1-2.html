I don’t oppose such a charge now, and now I see there is some merit to it. However, I still don’t think we should have strong opinions against both options.<br>Currently at where I live in California, there is a plastic bag charge of 10 cents per bag. People here just seem to accept the fact and honestly declare at the self-checkout counter in the grocery store on how many store-provided bags do they use. I pretty much have accepted the fact too - but that was mainly because there are other facts I still couldn’t accept.<br>I also visited Taipei once, they also impose a similar plastic bag charge. Interestingly, that plastic bags in Taipei have a fancy hologram label.<br>https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyi...<br>The plastic bag charge did change my behavior in California.<br>If I am buying only a few items I do not request for a plastic bag. For some items like a carton of eggs, I would have definitely requested for a plastic bag if there was not a charge, but now I would only request a bag only if I am buying more items. I will take the risk of having my eggs broken.<br>If I am buying many things from a grocery store, my housemate and I will try to remember to bring some plastic bags. There might be some plastic bags stored in the car that I use, but I am not too sure about that right now. (Of course, you should not keep to many visible things in your car to reduce the chances of getting your window smashed.)<br>I don’t see the point of driving to my house to get plastic bags if I forgot to have them in the car. The additional mileage and risk taken is not worth it, neither it is environmentally friendly. I see the plastic bag charge as a penalty for forgetting to bring a plastic bag.<br>I do not use a wastepaper basket for our trash can. When I was raised in Singapore we had been using a wastepaper basket for the entire house of four. The 3-gallon wastepaper basket sized trash can is lined with a 3-gallon plastic bag from the grocery store. When the trash can is full, we wrap it and throw it down the rubbish chute. On hindsight, this is quite an inefficient process because every time the trash is full, someone in the house needs to bend their back, tie the bag and throw it down the chute. Currently where I live in California, we have a 13 gallon trash can and a 13 gallon trash bag which costs $9 for 45 bags (20 cents per bag). We bag our trash and throw it probably once a week, we should have done this in Singapore too.<br>Of course, in Singapore you can express you frustration at the ballot box. However, please note that the Worker’s Party also called for the introduction of a single-use plastic charge.</td>

We need to be vigilant. We only got to where we are because of how hard we have worked, so we cannot squander what we have been given. We need to be #sgunited in order to reach our goal of being a covid resilient nation. The MMTF is keeping a close watch on the situation, and we will not hesitate to act when there is a need to.

Singaporean students who prefer continuous testing may already opt for the IB curriculum at certain high schools.<br>In the Singapore education system, admission to primary schools, secondary schools, junior colleges and polytechnics almost completely depends on the final national exams. It is possible to have zero school attendance (with permission if possible) except during the national exams, and you get your placements in the desired course with the examination certificate. This means there is almost no continuous testing in mainstream Singapore schools.<br>There was already some forms of continuous testing in the current system. They are not popular.<br>Science Practical Assessment (or SPA) is carried out for science subjects in the O and A levels. This is done a few months before the national examinations, and not all students take the assessment at the same time, even if they are from the same school.<br>A level Project Work. Admittedly, it is a much-needed sample of group projects in the universities and the real world. However, how junior colleges administer the course vary in quality, tutors from the same junior college also vary in quality.<br>It is more difficult to standardise continuous assessment. Even for national examinations, the quality of teaching material produced already vary greatly among schools, even though they come from the same funding source. Fairness and meritocracy is an important principle in the Singapore education system, and many of us would prefer not to sacrifice any more of these.<br>The current approach to continuous assessment is to treat it as a low-risk low-stakes assessment where the impact on the final grades is limited as long as the student has done their homework.<br>I have no idea why continuous testing is more flexible than one with only final examinations. As long as the programme is regulated by an international institution, there are a syllabus to follow and deadlines to meet.

I fell in love with Telegram when I can access it on a Raspberry Pi to copy terminal commands.<br>There are simple bots that you can use to moderate discussions.<br>Access to stickers. Messages are more interesting with words and emojis.<br>Large userbase and network effect. Since everyone is on Telegram, you have to be on Telegram to communicate with Singaporeans. Many news channels and government agencies, and even my Member of Parliament, has a Telegram channel.<br>Whatsapp is not preferred by young people now because<br>People may not want their contacts to be accessible by Facebook/Meta for their other products<br>Whatsapp, to their credit, is true end-to-end encryption. Unless you surrender your device and give them your password, in theory nobody else is not able to access your chats. However, this means that chat history is usually lost when you change devices.
