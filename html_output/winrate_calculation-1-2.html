      <td id="T_ce84b_row3_col0" class="data row3 col0" >What do you think of the newly imposed plastic bag charge in Singapore?<br><br>Tong Hui Kang<br>Machine Learning Engineer in Recommendations<br>From July 3 this year, customers will have to fork out at least 5 cents for each plastic bag that they take from large supermarket operators in Singapore.<br>https://www.channelnewsasia.com/...<br>This is required by law, which refers to plastic bags as “disposable carrier bags”.<br>https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Acts-Supp...<br>Here is some related conversation on Reddit.<br>https://www.reddit.com/r/singapo...<br>I have previously (four years ago) wrote an opinion.<br>Tong Hui Kang&#x27;s answer to Do you think that Singapore supermarkets should impose a levy on plastic bags?<br>My opinions have changed. I don’t oppose such a charge now, and now I see there is some merit to it. However, I still don’t think we should have strong opinions against both options.<br>Currently at where I live in California, there is a plastic bag charge of 10 cents per bag. People here just seem to accept the fact and honestly declare at the self-checkout counter in the grocery store on how many store-provided bags do they use. I pretty much have accepted the fact too - but that was mainly because there are other facts I still couldn’t accept.<br>I also visited Taipei once, they also impose a similar plastic bag charge. Interestingly, that plastic bags in Taipei have a fancy hologram label.<br>https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyi...<br>The plastic bag charge did change my behavior in California.<br>If I am buying only a few items I do not request for a plastic bag. For some items like a carton of eggs, I would have definitely requested for a plastic bag if there was not a charge, but now I would only request a bag only if I am buying more items. I will take the risk of having my eggs broken.<br>If I am buying many things from a grocery store, my housemate and I will try to remember to bring some plastic bags. There might be some plastic bags stored in the car that I use, but I am not too sure about that right now. (Of course, you should not keep to many visible things in your car to reduce the chances of getting your window smashed.)<br>I don’t see the point of driving to my house to get plastic bags if I forgot to have them in the car. The additional mileage and risk taken is not worth it, neither it is environmentally friendly. I see the plastic bag charge as a penalty for forgetting to bring a plastic bag.<br>I do not use a wastepaper basket for our trash can. When I was raised in Singapore we had been using a wastepaper basket for the entire house of four. The 3-gallon wastepaper basket sized trash can is lined with a 3-gallon plastic bag from the grocery store. When the trash can is full, we wrap it and throw it down the rubbish chute. On hindsight, this is quite an inefficient process because every time the trash is full, someone in the house needs to bend their back, tie the bag and throw it down the chute. Currently where I live in California, we have a 13 gallon trash can and a 13 gallon trash bag which costs $9 for 45 bags (20 cents per bag).

For the past two years he has been trained to give press conferences almost daily, defending current policies and the changes to current policies. The policies include the initial decision to close borders, group-size restriction and relaxation, choice of vaccines, TraceTogether and SafeEntry, vaccination differentiation requirements, and most recently reopening of the cross-border travel with Malaysia. I believe has sufficient real-world training to take on the role of the Prime Minister of Singapore.<br><br>Gif source<br>Of course, I do disagree with some of the decisions. When Covid cases have risen to the thousands, I fail to see how TraceTogether and SafeEntry have not ceased to be useful tools for contact tracing. When most Singaporeans have received the second dose of the vaccines, I do not think most of the Covid restrictions make sense for vaccinated individuals. This copypasta was popular on r/singapore subreddit - and this might be indicative of populism and risk-averseness we will continue to see in policy making.<br>What are you talking about? We already have a very clear and unambiguous roadmap. We are well on track to Stage A of our very concrete and well thought out roadmap.<br>What are we opening up you ask? That is also very clearly laid out. We have done well, but there is more we need to do as we transition into a covid resilient nation. There are still many unknowns. We are studying what other countries are doing, and we will learn from their successes and mistakes, and also learn from our own successes and mistakes, and we will implement a plan to help us transition into a covid resilient nation that takes into account our unique situation. We need to be vigilant. We only got to where we are because of how hard we have worked, so we cannot squander what we have been given. We need to be #sgunited in order to reach our goal of being a covid resilient nation. The MMTF is keeping a close watch on the situation, and we will not hesitate to act when there is a need to. We know it has been a frustrating time for everyone, but we ask for your patience as we do all we can to make sure that Singapore transitions into a covid resilient nation.<br><br>Lee Hsien Loong has offered to Singapore his sudoku solver, usually insightful commentary on foreign policy, and the vision for a “smart nation”, I am not sure what Lawrence Wong is offering besides continuing the tradition of how Singapore is governed.<br>Ultimately, Lee Hsien Loong is not going to live forever and it is really time for Lee Hsien Loong to hand over the baton. Regardless, I am okay with a Prime Minister who can understand policy criticisms and defend policy decisions, with national interests at heart. That is all I am asking for, and it seems that Lawrence Wong has proven his ability in how he led the response to Covid.</td>

      <td id="T_ce84b_row12_col0" class="data row12 col0" >Does Singapore need to move away from the inflexible British-based education system and towards a more flexible system that emphasizes continuous testing?<br><br>Tong Hui Kang<br>Machine Learning Engineer in Recommendations<br>I presume the British-based education system refers to the O and A levels, in addition to PSLE. Singaporean students who prefer continuous testing may already opt for the IB curriculum at certain high schools.<br>In the Singapore education system, admission to primary schools, secondary schools, junior colleges and polytechnics almost completely depends on the final national exams. It is possible to have zero school attendance (with permission if possible) except during the national exams, and you get your placements in the desired course with the examination certificate. This means there is almost no continuous testing in mainstream Singapore schools.<br>There was already some forms of continuous testing in the current system. They are not popular.<br>Science Practical Assessment (or SPA) is carried out for science subjects in the O and A levels. This is done a few months before the national examinations, and not all students take the assessment at the same time, even if they are from the same school.<br>A level Project Work. Admittedly, it is a much-needed sample of group projects in the universities and the real world. However, how junior colleges administer the course vary in quality, tutors from the same junior college also vary in quality.<br>It is more difficult to standardise continuous assessment. Even for national examinations, the quality of teaching material produced already vary greatly among schools, even though they come from the same funding source. Fairness and meritocracy is an important principle in the Singapore education system, and many of us would prefer not to sacrifice any more of these.<br>The current approach to continuous assessment is to treat it as a low-risk low-stakes assessment where the impact on the final grades is limited as long as the student has done their homework.<br>I have no idea why continuous testing is more flexible than one with only final examinations. As long as the programme is regulated by an international institution, there are a syllabus to follow and deadlines to meet. Only universities and polytechnics with degree and diploma-granting powers have the flexibility to modify the courses.</td>

The objective here is to fit a function f(caption) -&gt; image, by minimizing some loss function L(caption, image).<br>L(caption, image) is high when the image is unrelated to the caption, and L(caption, image) is low when the image is very related to the caption.
