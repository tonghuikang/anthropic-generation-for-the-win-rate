Sometimes, the author intends to disallow O(n3) solutions but allow O(n2 log n) solutions. Your Python solution, even though implemented in O(n2 log n), may be evaluated as Time Limit Exceeded.<br>Problems with strong memory constraints. Some problems on Codeforces impose unusual memory constraints as little as 32MB. These problems may require the use of variables with a small bit length (like C++ short), which is not a feature of Python.<br>Python grandmasters are few and far in between. There has only been one person who uses only Python, never C++, and reached Grandmaster.<br>However, Python is actually a good language for non-competitive competitive programming.<br>Most of the problems that solution will fail because you do not have a correct algorithm, not because of Python implementation.<br>When you start out competitive programming, you want to learn to craft and implement algorithms fast. Python code is less verbose, and concepts can be seen more clearly.<br>C++ is not that friendly to beginners - for example you need understand and juggle types and pointers. The same points that discusses what should be your first programming language also apply here.<br>The most recent problem that Python gave me a bunch of TLE is Question 4 of a recent Google Kick Start problem.<br>https://codingcompetitions.withg...<br>There are also a few ways you can reduce the occurrence of TLE with Python code<br>Use of PyPy3, which is a faster implementation of Python. Most competitive programming website has PyPy3 as a submission option. You do not need to change how you write the code, but usually implementations of PyPy3 do not implement libraries like numpy.<br>Avoid calling functions recursively - see this comment for an explanation and a workaround. I use a different workaround - I defined a function to call when I enter a node, and another function to call when I exit a node, and track the progress of the depth first search with a hashmap and stack. You can see how I implement it in the linked solution from Kick Start.<br>Avoid accessing list of lists. Probably you can use math and divmod to compute which indices should you access in the flattened matrix.<br>Libraries. C++ and Java has binary search trees built in, but not Python. I actually extracted a copy of the sortedcontainers library for use in contests.<br>Input output templates. I append input = sys.stdin.readline at the start of the code to read input faster. There is another template that is being used that is probably even faster.</td>

For example, if you are buying property worth more than 100k, you need to pay a stamp duty on the price of the property, which may be between 1% to 24%.<br>https://singaporelegaladvice.com...<br>This is the planned Singapore government revenue and expenditure right before the Covid struck.<br><br><br>https://www.reddit.com/r/singapo...<br>Stamp duty was projected to contribute 4.29 billion dollars of the total of 105 billion dollars of Singapore budget (which include a planned deficit of 10.5 billion). Significant, but not a lot.<br>The purpose of taxes is not to make Singapore government rich or “wealthy”, but to reallocate the resources to keep the country running. You can see how the money is spent - defense, education, health and transport.<br>Some money is stashed for investment purposes - we see that part of the income is generated by investment returns. Money is also needed to be stashed to respond to crises such as Covid - because of Covid, Singapore incurred a deficit of $64.9 billion in 2020.<br>https://www.todayonline.com/sing...</td>
