There has only been one person who uses only Python, never C++, and reached Grandmaster.<br>However, Python is actually a good language for non-competitive competitive programming.<br>Most of the problems that solution will fail because you do not have a correct algorithm, not because of Python implementation.<br>When you start out competitive programming, you want to learn to craft and implement algorithms fast. Python code is less verbose, and concepts can be seen more clearly.<br>C++ is not that friendly to beginners - for example you need understand and juggle types and pointers. The same points that discusses what should be your first programming language also apply here.<br>The most recent problem that Python gave me a bunch of TLE is Question 4 of a recent Google Kick Start problem.<br>https://codingcompetitions.withg...<br>There are also a few ways you can reduce the occurrence of TLE with Python code<br>Use of PyPy3, which is a faster implementation of Python. Most competitive programming website has PyPy3 as a submission option. You do not need to change how you write the code, but usually implementations of PyPy3 do not implement libraries like numpy.<br>Avoid calling functions recursively - see this comment for an explanation and a workaround. I use a different workaround - I defined a function to call when I enter a node, and another function to call when I exit a node, and track the progress of the depth first search with a hashmap and stack. You can see how I implement it in the linked solution from Kick Start.<br>Avoid accessing list of lists. Probably you can use math and divmod to compute which indices should you access in the flattened matrix.<br>Libraries. C++ and Java has binary search trees built in, but not Python. I actually extracted a copy of the sortedcontainers library for use in contests.<br>Input output templates. I append input = sys.stdin.readline at the start of the code to read input faster. There is another template that is being used that is probably even faster.</td>

[1][2]<br>Unlike previous models published by Stability AI, SD3 and SD3-Turbo were not open-weights models when they were published.<br>As of writing, SD3 costs 6.5 cents per image, whereas SD3-Turbo costs 4 cents per image.[3] This is competitive with DALL·E 3 at 4 cents per image, which has a similar performance.[4]<br>This article [5] from Stability AI describes how they distilled SD3-Turbo from SD3. In the abstract, the article states that<br>We introduce Latent Adversarial Diffusion Distillation (LADD), a novel distillation approach overcoming the limitations of ADD.<br>We apply LADD to Stable Diffusion 3 (8B) to obtain SD3-Turbo, a fast model that matches the performance of state-of-the-art text-to-image generators using only four unguided sampling steps.<br><br>In summary, SD3-Turbo is a distillation of SD3. In layperson language, SD3-Turbo is a smaller model (which is cheaper and faster to run) compared to SD3. The performance of SD3-Turbo might be slightly worse than SD3.<br>Here are some images generated with SD3 versus SD3-Turbo, at the boundary of their abilities:<br>a cat holding a sign with the word woof<br>SD3<br><br><br>SD3-Turbo<br><br><br>a chalkboard with the number 1 000 000 007<br>SD3<br><br><br>SD3-Turbo<br><br><br>Footnotes<br>[1] Stable Diffusion 3 — Stability AI<br>[2] Stable Diffusion 3 API Now Available — Stability AI<br>[3] Stability AI - Developer Platform<br>[4] Pricing<br>[5] Page on arxiv.org</td>
