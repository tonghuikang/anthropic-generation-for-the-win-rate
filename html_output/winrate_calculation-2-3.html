      <td id="T_be16e_row5_col0" class="data row5 col0" >How good is Python for competitive programming?<br><br>Tong Hui Kang<br>Machine Learning Engineer in Recommendations<br>I agree that you should not use Python if you are doing competitive programming competitively.<br>These are the situations where you should not learn Python<br>IOI and related contests (Only C++ is allowed for IOI 2022)<br>ICPC and related contests (good luck finding good teammates who also use Python)<br>Even if you are doing competitive programming non-competitively, these are the obstacles that you may face<br>Problems where the time constraints are tight. Sometimes, the author intends to disallow O(n3) solutions but allow O(n2 log n) solutions. Your Python solution, even though implemented in O(n2 log n), may be evaluated as Time Limit Exceeded.<br>Problems with strong memory constraints. Some problems on Codeforces impose unusual memory constraints as little as 32MB. These problems may require the use of variables with a small bit length (like C++ short), which is not a feature of Python.<br>Python grandmasters are few and far in between. There has only been one person who uses only Python, never C++, and reached Grandmaster.<br>However, Python is actually a good language for non-competitive competitive programming.<br>Most of the problems that solution will fail because you do not have a correct algorithm, not because of Python implementation.<br>When you start out competitive programming, you want to learn to craft and implement algorithms fast. Python code is less verbose, and concepts can be seen more clearly.<br>C++ is not that friendly to beginners - for example you need understand and juggle types and pointers. The same points that discusses what should be your first programming language also apply here.<br>The most recent problem that Python gave me a bunch of TLE is Question 4 of a recent Google Kick Start problem.<br>https://codingcompetitions.withg...<br>There are also a few ways you can reduce the occurrence of TLE with Python code<br>Use of PyPy3, which is a faster implementation of Python. Most competitive programming website has PyPy3 as a submission option. You do not need to change how you write the code, but usually implementations of PyPy3 do not implement libraries like numpy.<br>Avoid calling functions recursively - see this comment for an explanation and a workaround. I use a different workaround - I defined a function to call when I enter a node, and another function to call when I exit a node, and track the progress of the depth first search with a hashmap and stack. You can see how I implement it in the linked solution from Kick Start.<br>Avoid accessing list of lists. Probably you can use math and divmod to compute which indices should you access in the flattened matrix.<br>Libraries. C++ and Java has binary search trees built in, but not Python. I actually extracted a copy of the sortedcontainers library for use in contests.<br>Input output templates. I append input = sys.stdin.readline at the start of the code to read input faster. There is another template that is being used that is probably even faster.</td>

Significant, but not a lot.<br>The purpose of taxes is not to make Singapore government rich or “wealthy”, but to reallocate the resources to keep the country running. You can see how the money is spent - defense, education, health and transport.<br>Some money is stashed for investment purposes - we see that part of the income is generated by investment returns.
