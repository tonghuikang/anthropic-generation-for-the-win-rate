Children who score the best in examinations can enrol to an elite school. However, why do we even have elite schools? Is the fetishisation of elite schools good for society?<br>Take for instance admission into a small range of elite schools or the award of prestigious scholarships.<br>This criticism is concerned with the elitism that arises when we privilege a narrow range of rewards.<br><br>Meritocracy is problematic because meritocracy perpetuates the narrative that people are where they are because of their merit.<br>This national narrative, which is reproduced in the individual stories that Singaporeans tell themselves, is one of surmounting odds through hard work and skill.<br>Those who succeed are proclaimed as legitimately deserving. What is left implicit is that those at the bottom have failed to be deserving.<br>But this narrative fails to capture the multifaceted reasons why people may fail to succeed in Singapore’s system.<br>According to those who advance this critique, the real culprit is the dominance of the system which perpetuates the sense of inferiority among those who are unrewarded.</td>

You can choose to put in the bare minimum effort for your projects and examinations, or you can choose to get to the top of the class. You can choose to complete just one unremarkable internship to fulfill graduation requirements, or you can choose to hustle and grind for the most coveted internships.<br>This is what I summarize as the main differences between SUTD and NUS/NTU<br>The first year in SUTD is held in the classroom, which mean you will interact with the same classmates for all courses for two or three semesters.<br>The first year in SUTD is common. The classmates you work with in the first year may not get the same degree with you i.e. “interdisciplinary experience”.<br>Most courses have group projects.<br>The cohort size of SUTD is small (still around 400 to 500).<br>If you are aiming for the top grades, doing well by yourself alone is not sufficient. As SUTD has more course projects, you need to get your project group mates to contribute. It is also not feasible to do all the work for your course projects. This could contribute to stress.<br>You are more likely to have more friends and acquaintances from the first year you spend together in SUTD. This might contribute to less stress. Or more.<br>As SUTD is an engineering-focused university with an unsurprising gender ratio, if you are a heterosexual male looking for a traditional relationship, you might feel more stress. Or less, if you do not care about a relationship.<br>As the cohort size is small, there is less flexibility for the curriculum. Most required classes are only held once per year. If you fail the course, you usually could only retake the course in one year later. This might give significant pressure if you are failing the course. This could contribute to stress.<br>There is less awareness of how high the ceiling is, because of the small cohort size. Throughout my years, I am not aware of anyone in my cohort who scored a Bay Area internship, or interned at Google and Facebook in Singapore. I thought that was simply impossible. There are people who did that in NUS (probably not as often in NTU), see Reddit thread for reference.

The process of doing a title transfer with the DMV Virtual Office is lengthy is prone to errors.<br>These are the alternatives I recommend<br>Spend a day queuing at the DMV to process the title transfer in-person<br>Schedule a visit to a AAA branch to process a title transfer, but I think they do charge a premium<br>If you still insist on doing a title transfer with the DMV Virtual Office, I describe the steps that I have gone through.<br>This video from the DMV describes the initial steps you need to go through<br>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=...<br>I want to emphasize some things in this process<br>The order of the first name and the last name is not conventional on the title transfer form. Please READ carefully.<br>If a smog test was done on the vehicle recently, you should include the smog test certification in the Additional Related Documents, in case they ask for it. This may save you one email exchange.<br>You will also need to submit the Notice of Transfer and Release of Liability online. This lets DMV know that the seller is no longer responsible for parking/traffic violations or civil or criminal actions associated with the vehicle after the date of sale.<br>That is the easy part. You will receive an email with a case number where you can check the status of your case. Note that the page does not always load and you may need to refresh multiple times for the information to be displayed.<br>Now the hard part begins. You don’t know whether you have done the steps correctly. This is why I recommend spending a day in-person at the DMV or schedule a visit at the AAA branch instead, because the errors will be surfaced on the spot.<br>Additional documents might be requested. In my case, the Smog Certificate was requested.<br><br><br>I submitted my Smog Certificate by replying to the email they sent. After I submitted my Smog Certification, for quite some time I was unsure whether they have received my Smog Certificate. But if you look carefully in the screenshot, you see “Additional files were received with this case and are under review”, which is not obvious.<br>When they are satisfied with your softcopy documents, you will need to make a payment. Note there there is an additional 2% for using a credit or debit card. The alternative involves sending some account and routing numbers which could take days to execute, so I would rather pay the extra 2%.<br>After they have confirmed that they have received the payment, you will need to send the original title by mail. This is why I recommend that you use DMV Virtual Office if you know the seller well, because the title might get lost in the way.<br><br><br>I used USPS Priority Mail, which was around $10, to mail the original title. If you feel rich you could use Priority Mail Express, which is faster and costs $30. I sent my mail at a USPS Post Office. I needed to handwrite my full address and the DMV’s address on the USPS envelope and hope that the computer parses my handwriting correctly. The destination is apparently a mailbox (PO box) where DMV will retrieve the documents from once in a while.<br>USPS Priority Mail has tracking. It was recorded that the mail reached the PO box on Monday noon. However, my document is only processed on Thursday noon.<br>The process, when complete, should look something like this.<br><br><br>I write this for informational purposes only and I am not liable for any damages caused.</td>

      <td id="T_4d689_row19_col0" class="data row19 col0" >Should you still include a prompt when fine-tuning?<br><br>Tong Hui Kang<br>Machine Learning Engineer in Recommendations<br>The point of fine-tuning is to avoid writing prompts. In OpenAI’s fine-tuning guide, fine-tuning is only recommended when it’s easier to “show, not tell”. This therefore raises the question on whether do we still need to include a prompt when fine-tuning.<br>However, I still suggest that you use a prompt and a concise one. For example, you want a solution that summarizes the content of the email in the title. A solution from pure prompt engineering would include long instructions on capitalization, what to focus on, and content length, for example. The prompt, when you do fine-tuning, should be just “Summarize the content of the email as a title”.<br>There is this idea that it is easier to learn from the mistakes that you make, compared to the mistakes that someone else has made. It also means that it is easier to repeat what you could have done rather than what someone else could have done. It is more likely for the pre-fine-tuned model to arrive at your intended email titles if you include a concise prompt. I have not studied the research backing up this idea here.<br>However, with more input tokens, it will cost more in terms of compute, and therefore more money.<br>I don’t think you should include any more than the minimum context here. I expect that the model will learn style from your fine-tuning dataset, and having very detailed prompts might detract from that objective. Again, I have not studied the research backing up this idea here.<br>Note that if you include a prompt in the fine-tuning dataset, you need to make sure you include the same prompt in production in the same exact format.</td>
