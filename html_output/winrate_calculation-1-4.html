      <td id="T_fed47_row2_col0" class="data row2 col0" >What do you think of the newly imposed plastic bag charge in Singapore?<br><br>Tong Hui Kang<br>Machine Learning Engineer in Recommendations<br>From July 3 this year, customers will have to fork out at least 5 cents for each plastic bag that they take from large supermarket operators in Singapore.<br>https://www.channelnewsasia.com/...<br>This is required by law, which refers to plastic bags as “disposable carrier bags”.<br>https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Acts-Supp...<br>Here is some related conversation on Reddit.<br>https://www.reddit.com/r/singapo...<br>I have previously (four years ago) wrote an opinion.<br>Tong Hui Kang&#x27;s answer to Do you think that Singapore supermarkets should impose a levy on plastic bags?<br>My opinions have changed. I don’t oppose such a charge now, and now I see there is some merit to it. However, I still don’t think we should have strong opinions against both options.<br>Currently at where I live in California, there is a plastic bag charge of 10 cents per bag. People here just seem to accept the fact and honestly declare at the self-checkout counter in the grocery store on how many store-provided bags do they use. I pretty much have accepted the fact too - but that was mainly because there are other facts I still couldn’t accept.<br>I also visited Taipei once, they also impose a similar plastic bag charge. Interestingly, that plastic bags in Taipei have a fancy hologram label.<br>https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyi...<br>The plastic bag charge did change my behavior in California.<br>If I am buying only a few items I do not request for a plastic bag. For some items like a carton of eggs, I would have definitely requested for a plastic bag if there was not a charge, but now I would only request a bag only if I am buying more items. I will take the risk of having my eggs broken.<br>If I am buying many things from a grocery store, my housemate and I will try to remember to bring some plastic bags. There might be some plastic bags stored in the car that I use, but I am not too sure about that right now. (Of course, you should not keep to many visible things in your car to reduce the chances of getting your window smashed.)<br>I don’t see the point of driving to my house to get plastic bags if I forgot to have them in the car. The additional mileage and risk taken is not worth it, neither it is environmentally friendly. I see the plastic bag charge as a penalty for forgetting to bring a plastic bag.<br>I do not use a wastepaper basket for our trash can. When I was raised in Singapore we had been using a wastepaper basket for the entire house of four. The 3-gallon wastepaper basket sized trash can is lined with a 3-gallon plastic bag from the grocery store. When the trash can is full, we wrap it and throw it down the rubbish chute. On hindsight, this is quite an inefficient process because every time the trash is full, someone in the house needs to bend their back, tie the bag and throw it down the chute. Currently where I live in California, we have a 13 gallon trash can and a 13 gallon trash bag which costs $9 for 45 bags (20 cents per bag). We bag our trash and throw it probably once a week, we should have done this in Singapore too.<br>Of course, in Singapore you can express you frustration at the ballot box. However, please note that the Worker’s Party also called for the introduction of a single-use plastic charge.</td>

For the past two years he has been trained to give press conferences almost daily, defending current policies and the changes to current policies. The policies include the initial decision to close borders, group-size restriction and relaxation, choice of vaccines, TraceTogether and SafeEntry, vaccination differentiation requirements, and most recently reopening of the cross-border travel with Malaysia. I believe has sufficient real-world training to take on the role of the Prime Minister of Singapore.<br><br>Gif source<br>Of course, I do disagree with some of the decisions. When Covid cases have risen to the thousands, I fail to see how TraceTogether and SafeEntry have not ceased to be useful tools for contact tracing. When most Singaporeans have received the second dose of the vaccines, I do not think most of the Covid restrictions make sense for vaccinated individuals. This copypasta was popular on r/singapore subreddit - and this might be indicative of populism and risk-averseness we will continue to see in policy making.<br>What are you talking about? We already have a very clear and unambiguous roadmap. We are well on track to Stage A of our very concrete and well thought out roadmap.<br>What are we opening up you ask? That is also very clearly laid out. We have done well, but there is more we need to do as we transition into a covid resilient nation. There are still many unknowns. We are studying what other countries are doing, and we will learn from their successes and mistakes, and also learn from our own successes and mistakes, and we will implement a plan to help us transition into a covid resilient nation that takes into account our unique situation. We need to be vigilant. We only got to where we are because of how hard we have worked, so we cannot squander what we have been given. We need to be #sgunited in order to reach our goal of being a covid resilient nation. The MMTF is keeping a close watch on the situation, and we will not hesitate to act when there is a need to. We know it has been a frustrating time for everyone, but we ask for your patience as we do all we can to make sure that Singapore transitions into a covid resilient nation.<br><br>Lee Hsien Loong has offered to Singapore his sudoku solver, usually insightful commentary on foreign policy, and the vision for a “smart nation”, I am not sure what Lawrence Wong is offering besides continuing the tradition of how Singapore is governed.<br>Ultimately, Lee Hsien Loong is not going to live forever and it is really time for Lee Hsien Loong to hand over the baton. Regardless, I am okay with a Prime Minister who can understand policy criticisms and defend policy decisions, with national interests at heart. That is all I am asking for, and it seems that Lawrence Wong has proven his ability in how he led the response to Covid.</td>

If so, where do they buy them from?<br><br>Tong Hui Kang<br>Machine Learning Engineer in Recommendations<br>Actually an interesting question.<br>In Primary school (Year 1–6) and Lower Secondary school (Year 7–8), we have a booklist that is produced by the school. It looks something like this. [1]<br><br><br>As mentioned in the booklist, you can buy the books in the school bookshop. Apparently, some books are cheaper in a nationwide bookstore Popular bookstore compared to the school bookshop, and parents might save a few dollars buying from there. Probably I might not had paid attention, I did not remember anyone reusing a textbook, other than one possibly from their elder sibling. There are donation drives [3] where you can donate and collect textbooks.<br>You see that there are textbooks and activity books. Lessons are conducted with the textbook. Homework is written in the activity book. When the homework is due, the activity book is passed to the teacher, who will mark the homework and return the activity book in the next lesson or two.<br>For Upper Secondary school (Year 9–10) and Junior College (Year 11–12), there are no longer activity books (at least in the secondary school that I have studied in).<br><br><br>The studies in Upper Secondary is geared towards preparation for the national examinations, such as the O levels. There are no longer activity books that you need to submit, but there is still (a lot of) homework. Homework is now printed in A4 paper, and you write your solutions on the paper or on additional foolscap papers. Students might need to pay for printing.<br>There might not be a market for Upper Secondary activity books because teachers want to decide exactly what questions should the students work on for homework. The student cohorts in different classes or different schools can vary significantly in their academic ability, and it is hard to craft a one-size-fits-all problem set.<br>For math and science subjects, you see that there is also these topical books. It is a required purchase, even though I don’t remember opening these books at all. The questions found in the A4-printed homework are actually from these topical books. The school requires the students to buy these books to protect the school from copyright lawsuits.<br>Students will also need to buy the Ten Year Series (TYS). The TYS contains the questions from the national examinations from the past ten years, and will be heavily used closer to the dates of the national examinations. Again, this is a required purchase to protect the school from lawsuits. A class representative will be collecting the money from everyone in the class.<br>In Junior College, we do not have textbooks anymore. The content is mostly delivered the slides, which will be uploaded into school learning management portal. Students are still required to buy books with the problem statements and Ten Year Series (or Thirty Year Series) for the same reason.<br>[1] Anglo-Chinese School Booklist<br>[2] Anderson Secondary School Booklist<br>[3] S&#x27;pore public urged to donate another 150,000 pre-loved textbooks to hit 500,000 target</td>
