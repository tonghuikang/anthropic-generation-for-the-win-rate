      <td id="T_4bf33_row3_col0" class="data row3 col0" >Should you fine-tune from a base model or an instruct model?<br><br>Tong Hui Kang<br>Machine Learning Engineer in Recommendations<br>Understand the definitions of pre-training, post-training, and fine-tuning.<br>- Pre-training is the stage where you take all the text from the Internet and train a next-token predictor. The output is a base model. Note that this base model is not useful for downstream applications (you can try to experience it yourself with OpenAI davinci-002).<br>- Post-training is the stage where you align the model to make coherent replies to user questions. There is a paper (Less is More for Alignment) that says 1000 examples in enough. I think the actual number should be in the millions. There are different methods to do post-training - SFT, RLHF, and DPO, just to name a few. We call the data used in post-training the post-training dataset. The output is an instruct model.<br>- Fine-tuning is the stage where you give the model a small amount of examples (50 to 100) so that the model produces responses in a style that you want. The output is a fine-tuned model.<br>There is a lot of work done in the post-training that you might want to inherit. Models fine-tuned from instruct models should know how to handle multi-turn conversations even though your fine-tuning dataset may consist of only single-turn responses. Models fine-tuned from instruct models inherit the safeguards that you might want for free. Models fine-tuned from instruct models inherit some ability to handle out-of-sample queries.<br>You need more examples to fine-tune from a base model. For the base models, OpenAI mentioned in 2022 that needed to “aim for at least ~500 examples”. For the instruct models OpenAI recommends “starting with 50 well-crafted demonstrations”. For instruct models, you can see that the model is imitating the style of your fine-tuning dataset with only 10 examples. For base models, you need many more examples before you can feel the difference between from base model you fine-tuned from. It is more encouraging to fine-tune from an instruct model where you can see progress with a little manual work, compared to fine-tuning from a base model.<br>OpenAI seems to prefer that you fine-tune from their instruct models. OpenAI’s current fine-tuning guide is focused on fine-tuning instruct models. I had to dig the archives for the statement that base models need at least 500 examples. OpenAI also considers its completion APIs as legacy.<br>The open-source community tends to prefer to fine-tune from base models. For most models, even the open-weights models, the post-training dataset is not published. You do not know exactly what the model is tuned to do or not to do. A base model is a compression of the Internet and is mostly unopinionated, whereas the post-training dataset is very opinionated on what should the intended response be.<br>The instruct model tends to be less creative than the base model. In May 2023, Andrej Karpathy shared that if he wanted a model that generates Pokemon names, he would use a base model to do that. The base model has lots of entropy and gives lots of diverse outputs. Therefore, if you want to generate more diverse outputs, you might want to fine-tune from the base model.</td>

      <td id="T_4bf33_row19_col0" class="data row19 col0" >Should you fine-tune an LLM, or just do prompt engineering?<br><br>Tong Hui Kang<br>Machine Learning Engineer in Recommendations<br>You should always start with the simplest solution. The simplest solution is prompt engineering. See these arguments for simplicity. By shipping, you get to see what prompt engineering can achieve. You also have access to data that could be used to fine-tune your model.<br>Fine-tuned models may be cheaper for the same performance. There are claims where you can achieve GPT-4 performance with a 7B model which can be served for cheap. However, the benchmark you need to beat now is Claude-3-Haiku, which is $0.25/$1.25. General-purpose LLMs are only getting cheaper over time, whereas the cost to serve your fine-tuned model is the same. General-purpose LLMs are easier to serve at scale because they can batch multiple requests.<br>You should also consider the cost of shipping a solution with fine-tuning. You need to think of how much you are getting paid. If you spend one engineer-month to fine-tune something to reduce a yearly cost of $500 to $200, are you really saving costs?<br>Fine-tuning may not solve your problem if prompt engineering can’t. If you cannot prompt engineer your way to generate a good response at least 10% of the time, fine-tuning will not save you. Fine-tuning only changes the style of the response. Fine-tuning does not increase the capabilities of the model or truly give the model new knowledge.<br>Try squeezing performance out of prompt engineering and function calling first. You might be not correctly doing prompt engineering. You can provide feedback to general-purpose LLM. If you want to build a chatbot that writes a certain flavor of SQL, just execute the SQL and provide the error feedback to the chatbot. General-purpose LLMs may just adopt the feedback pretty well.<br>There are many pitfalls that come along with fine-tuning. For prompt engineering, it is obvious if it works. If it does not work, change the prompt. For fine-tuning, if it does not work, it is not easy for a beginner to know what went wrong. There are many places where it could go wrong.<br>Collecting a fine-tuning dataset is hard. Collecting a good fine-tuning dataset is not easy If writing a 100-word prompt is hard, collecting a 100-example fine-tuning dataset is even harder.<br>It is possible that prompt engineering is harder than fine-tuning. In cases where it is easier to show rather than tell, fine-tuning makes more sense. It might be easier to collect and show 100 or 1000 examples than to write lengthy instructions for the model. An example of this use case is to generate interview questions based on the interviewee’s background. It is really hard to put down in words the qualities of a good question. Few-shot prompts may not work because they do not fully describe what you want. You will need to change the prompt when you change the model. Each model has their idiosyncrasies that you might need to specifically prompt against. New models are better and cheaper and old proprietary models will be deprecated. If you have a good fine-tuning dataset, you could probably just use the same dataset.<br>You might need a fine-tuning dataset anyway. If you making serious LLM applications, you need evaluation even if you are only doing prompt engineering. The fine-tuning dataset can be repurposed into an evaluation dataset.<br>It depends on the current state of the art. It depends on whether are there powerful models available to fine-tune. It depends on whether the performance of general-purpose models is much better than the models available to fine-tune. It depends on whether there are used platforms for fine-tuning. It depends on whether are there easy-to-use platforms for prompt engineering. It depends on the prices of calling general-purpose models versus deployed fine-tuned models.<br>You just need to do fine-tuning anyway. You might just need to write a paper on how fine-tuning a certain dataset can “achieve a performance better than GPT-4” on a certain specific task. Or your client is paying you money and they do not appreciate a 100-word well-written prompt with rigorous evaluations. You want to build capability for your organization, or you want to tick certain checkboxes for yourself. It is still good for the company if there are a few people who know the nature of fine-tuning. Instead of regarding fine-tuning as a cure-all solution only if you had more staffing, it is good to know what are you missing (or what are you not missing). If this is the actual reason to fine-tune, you need to be aware and be honest.</td>
