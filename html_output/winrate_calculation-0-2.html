The main benefit of subscription is that you can access premium questions, and statistics on the frequency of questions asked by companies. It appears that if someone manages to get all the questions from LeetCode and the information on frequency of the interviewed questions, there is no more value LeetCode has to its subscribers.<br>The list of questions from LeetCode has already been replicated in many places, although it seems that LeetCode is not invoking the copyright law as aggressively as CodeSignal. There are also many places where interview information is shared, such as in cscareers.dev, teamblind, and also on many other forums. These threats have already materialized, and LeetCode is still around, having new contests every week (some with merchandise as prizes) and updating the question bank.<br>LeetCode has since diversified from have only subscription revenue. They have a Chinese platform - which not only have the same information as the international version, but also they also have tools for interview and testing, with their large database of questions and benchmarked solutions.<br>https://e.leetcode-cn.com/<br>Probably their biggest threat now is to be profitable in the long run with their diversification - I don’t have statistics on the amount of revenue they are getting from each source, relative to their expenditure.</td>
