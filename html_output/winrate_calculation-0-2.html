It seems governments of other English-speaking countries (US, UK, Canada, Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, etc.) just call visas &quot;visas&quot;.<br><br>Tong Hui Kang<br>Machine Learning Engineer in Recommendations<br>It seems that there is some intention of the difference in nomenclature.<br>https://www.mfa.gov.sg/Overseas-...<br>13. What is the difference between visa and visit pass?<br>Answer: Visitors must note that Singapore visa is not an immigration pass. It is a pre-entry permission for the holder of a valid Singapore visa to travel to, and seek entry, into Singapore. Possessing a valid visa does not guarantee entry into Singapore.<br><br>My interpretation is that visa is related to whether can you come into Singapore, and the type of pass is related to what can you do in Singapore.<br>Citizen of some countries can travel into Singapore visa-free, while citizens of other countries need to apply for a visa to Singapore and have it approved by Singapore.<br>https://www.ica.gov.sg/enter-dep...<br>However, even if you have a visa and managed to enter Singapore, the activities you can do in Singapore are limited. If you want to study, work or rent in Singapore, you need to apply for a pass. If you are coming in only as a tourist, you do not need a pass.<br>https://www.mom.gov.sg/passes-an...</td>

Do you read the question correctly? Why did you misread the question? Think of what you were wasting time thinking of, and whether you could have avoided that line of thought.<br>Could you have written code in a way that is less prone to errors? Why did you get confused by your own code? Why did you use the wrong variable in that line of code? Having descriptive and consistent variable names helps (and it also helps your interviewer understand your code too).<br>Reflect on whether could you have done it given your knowledge. You know binary search, you know Dijkstra, why did you think of using these two to solve the problem? Reflect why you did not manage to use that knowledge.<br>Are there templates you should collect and reuse? Do you really need to recall from scratch some of the algorithms? If keep a handbook of common algorithms it will make your implementation faster. For interviews, you might still need to understand and memorize these templates.</td>

The main benefit of subscription is that you can access premium questions, and statistics on the frequency of questions asked by companies. It appears that if someone manages to get all the questions from LeetCode and the information on frequency of the interviewed questions, there is no more value LeetCode has to its subscribers.<br>The list of questions from LeetCode has already been replicated in many places, although it seems that LeetCode is not invoking the copyright law as aggressively as CodeSignal. There are also many places where interview information is shared, such as in cscareers.dev, teamblind, and also on many other forums. These threats have already materialized, and LeetCode is still around, having new contests every week (some with merchandise as prizes) and updating the question bank.<br>LeetCode has since diversified from have only subscription revenue. They have a Chinese platform - which not only have the same information as the international version, but also they also have tools for interview and testing, with their large database of questions and benchmarked solutions.<br>https://e.leetcode-cn.com/<br>Probably their biggest threat now is to be profitable in the long run with their diversification - I don’t have statistics on the amount of revenue they are getting from each source, relative to their expenditure.</td>
