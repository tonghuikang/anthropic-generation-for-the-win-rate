"How would you rate the success of the Olympic Games in Paris?

Aside from the athlete living conditions, [1]the 2024 Olympics were a smashing success. To me, it was a solid 9/10 event or an A- grade—whichever scale you prefer.

I wasn’t overly impressed by the hosts. The athletes were stuck with uncomfortable beds, unreliable air conditioning, and other problems that may have impeded their results (for those that didn’t opt to stay in a hotel instead). The opening ceremony was…bizarre. Maybe not sacrilegious if you buy that it’s a Greek influence, but surely not the best the city had to offer. I much preferred Beijing’s 2008 ceremony or 2012’s ceremony—both showcases of their host country’s culture and style.

But forget about the hosts.

This Olympics was a smashing success because of the athletes. This was an incredible assortment of athletes, from the decorated veterans to the breakout stars, all competing for glory together and providing storylines for several events.

Those storylines propelled the Olympics to several records, including massive streaming records for NBC’s Peacock, which managed 30.6 million viewers a day and 23.5 billion minutes of total streams—a 40% increase from all prior Olympics combined. [2] Ticket sales were up, ad attention was up, basically everything related to revenue was up and FAR above the Tokyo Olympics, which suffered from the effects of the pandemic.

This single-handedly proved that the world market for sports is alive and well, and the internet is facilitating the spread of the events. The Olympics account alone gained 32 million followers during the games, triple the gain it experienced in 2021!

Enough about the stats, though. Here’s my favorite moments.


GYMNASTICS

27-year-old Simone Biles, the most decorated Olympic gymnast in history, came back for her third Olympics and waltzed away with three more gold medals—including the team all-around, the individual all-around, and the vault. In gymnastic years, she’s ancient, but the GOAT was more than a match for her competition. Everybody wanted to see the GOAT perform what could be her last few routines before a well-deserved retirement.

The controversial subplot was Jordan Chiles’ bronze medal dispute. Here’s a short rundown: Chiles completed her routine, the judges scored it incorrectly, Chiles submitted an appeal and had it corrected so that she received a bronze. Afterward, the Romanians complained that her appeal was not within a minute (as the rules demand) and won that challenge, taking the bronze away. Now, video evidence emerged that proved Chiles made her appeal in time and the case is going to the Swiss, who have an even higher say. It’s a mess and it’s not over. I’m rooting for Chiles.


BASKETBALL

ALL of the biggest superstars in the NBA showed up for basketball. Even the Americans bought in, with the most talented roster since 1992, including the two most popular players in the world and former diehard rivals Steph Curry and LeBron James. They developed incredible chemistry that resulted in All-Olympic Team appearances for both, an electrifying 30 PPG in the final two games for Steph, and an Olympics MVP for LeBron. I loved every minute of their games.

On the international side, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Nikola Jokić, and Victor Wembanyama generated considerable fan love from their teams and the latter two took their teams to very respectable finishes—just behind Team USA, in my opinion.


TENNIS

The GOAT of tennis, Novak Djokovic, only needed ONE title to complete his collection—the Olympic gold. The best of the next generation and defending champion at Roland Garros, Carlos Alcaraz, tried to stop him. Either Alcaraz would become the youngest gold medalist or Djokovic would become the oldest (in men’s tennis), and Djokovic defied the odds to win—becoming the ONLY man to ever win the gold medal without dropping a set.

This was the ultimate showdown and most entertaining finale imaginable. We also got to see Alcaraz play with Rafael Nadal in doubles, putting all the Spanish talent (and almost all the Spanish Slams) on a single, loaded squad. It was a delight to watch.


TRACK & FIELD

Where to even begin? You have to highlight the GOAT, Sydney McLaughlin-Leurone, who dominated the field. Gotta give shoutouts to Gabby Thomas and Noah Lyles and all the other superstars who brought a lot of attention to the sport. But as far as I’m concerned, nothing was as exciting as the two major American upsets: Quincy Hall in the 400M and Cole Hocker in the 1500M, both with improbable last-second dashes that won them the gold.

This tends to be the most popular event in the Olympics and it deserves that title. The only embarrassing bit was that stupid 4x100 relay from the American guys. They messed it up again! Good thing the American women decimated the field.


I could go on and on. There were SO many good moments.

But you get the idea.

The Paris Olympics were electrifying. I give lots of credit to Peacock for providing all the wonderful features, such as multi-view, automatic highlights, and helpful programs like Gold Zone to keep track of all the most interesting events of the day.

For many reasons, this was my favorite Olympics. Hope LA is even better.

"Who is more of a pure talent, Lebron or Curry?

I saw a recent interview with Team USA, where basketball players shared when they first dunked. Some guys dunked at 11 or 12. A few were “late bloomers” who didn’t dunk until 17. Steph didn’t dunk until he was 19 years old.

This kid’s never survived on talent. Never. He’s 6′3″ with shoes, four inches shorter than the NBA average. He’s got a solid vertical (35.5″) but would never have made it to the NBA if not for his shooting ability. His height plus his less “glamorous” college career made him a risky first-round pick. The Warriors grabbed him with the 7th pick. They had no idea

Compare that to LeBron.

He was a 6′7″ 16-year-old and unstoppable in high school. His numbers were unreal—not just the scoring, either, but the rebounding and passing, too. LeBron clocked a vertical north of 40 inches, more than enough to dunk on anybody in the league. The King didn’t need to really workshop his shooting until several years into his career. That’s talent.

I mean no disrespect to either player. Steph’s still very talented and LeBron still put a LOT of work in. But if they both won the genetic lottery, Steph won $10 million and LeBron won $100 million. Guys like Steph happen. They just rarely have the same shooting foundation (thanks to an NBA father) and work ethic to pull off his career. Guys like LeBron are much rarer. But neither could have survived with just talent or skill. That’s no longer possible in the league."
"Why do all the marching bands from Japanese high schools seem to be made of mostly girls?

It’s seen as a boy thing in Japan to participate in sports like baseball, this leaves marching band completely wide open for the girls. It’s also a boy thing in America to play sports the difference is that in America if you aren’t varsity, generally people will just drop out of baseball or football, and do other things. We don’t stay on a team if we never get to play. That leaves these guys open to joining marching band. In Japan from what I understand, baseball teams might have hundreds of members even though only 9 are needed. Why you would join a sports team even though you have zero chance to actually play a game, that’s a question I don’t know, someone from Japan will have to answer that."
"Is California as bad as the right wing says it is?

Many of the problems that some of the political right point out in California are accurate.

State income taxes are high on high income earners, and the California state bureaucracy is monstrous in size and monstrously inefficient.

San Francisco really does have a problem with homeless people, including many drug addicts; it's not hard to find needles and human feces on sidewalks. Until a recent crackdown, there was a serious problem with car break-ins; even so, I don't leave anything visible in my car when I park in SF, not even my school parking permit that hangs from my rearview mirror.

In San Francisco, Los Angeles, San Jose, and San Diego, petty crime isn't being policed particularly heavily, which is forcing some businesses to take measures. As an example, stores in Westgate Mall in San Jose have their gates to the mall common area closed (if they have outside entrances) and close the changing rooms in the evening. A number of stores have closed, especially in SF and Oakland.

The California state legislature has a heavy hand in education, even dictating rules about general education requirements at all California public colleges and universities. And yes, there's a pretty significant DEI component to that, a fact that most folks on the right don't like. They have also made laws that make it more difficult to enact discipline in K-12 schools.

At the same time, many of the claims are wrong or overstated.

As I noted above, taxes are high on high income earners, but for most of us, the taxes aren't really all that bad. because of regressive taxation and nickel and diming, I paid a higher percentage of my income when I lived in St. Louis WHEN YOU COUNT ALL STATE AND LOCAL TAXES.

And taxes certainly are not what makes California expensive (that's housing). Housing costs can easily be double or triple the costs in comparable municipalities elsewhere in the US (e.g., comparing SF to Chicago or St. Louis). Housing is expensive because too many people want to live here, and because both practical and political considerations make it difficult to build new housing. That problem is not going to get solved anytime soon.

For as much as I find the state legislators control over general education and other requirements to be frustrating, the motive is to make transfer success a more common outcome.

Problems with homeless populations have more to do with weather than anything else; Houston and Dallas would be inundated with homeless people if the temperatures never gone very high or low. The same drug problems in California (heroin, fentanyl, and meth) are equally prevalent elsewhere.

California is definitely not a utopia, but it's also not a wasteland. I found that a lot of right wing characterizations have presented California as though it were some scenario out of Mad Max. It's not.

As a final note, every year for the last few years there has been some kind of weather-related crisis in Texas that has been poorly handled by both the utilities grids and state response. Houston's problems are exacerbated by… well, I would say poor city planning, but that would imply that there was planning involved. Houston is particularly proud of the fact that, for the purposes of municipal planning, they are a libertarian utopia. Every state and every municipality has its problems.

ETA It occurred to me that there is one major issue in California, possibly the worst issue for the long term, and the right never seems to mention it. Our water system is… not good. This is mostly in the southern part of the state, including the Inland Empire. We have enough water for home use, although we have to pipe it around. The big issue is agriculture, where we’re using groundwater far faster than it can be replaced. There is a forthcoming crisis. But the right doesn’t seem worried…"

"Are anti-depressants worth a shot?

What is your alternative? Talk therapy? Alcohol? Drugs? Nothing?

Whenever you wonder if your depression deserves to be treated, the answer is almost always yes. That said, the discussion about antidepressants should be between you and your care provider.

You might have read that the efficacy of antidepressants is not great and you’d be right. These drugs are only about 20% more effective than placebo and they can come with significant side effects. The efficacy is higher when depression is more severe. This is why psychiatrists reserve antidepressants for moderate and severe depressive cases and not mild ones. Your psychiatrist can prescribe an antidepressant based on your symptoms and the medication’s side effect profile. Combining antidepressants also increases its efficacy.

Yes, antidepressants are worth a shot because you are worth a shot at happiness.

"What organ exactly dies last in a human body?

It’s helpful to consider dying as a process, rather than an event.

If you’re looking at organs as a whole, muscle and skin survive several hours after circulation has stopped, and bone might survive a little longer.

If you’re looking at cell populations, chondrocytes [ https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chondrocyte ] (cells embedded in cartilage) have a very low metabolic rate. They receive all their oxygen by diffusion, since there are no blood vessels in cartilage. It’s quite possible to find living chondrocytes several days after death; the chondrocytes still haven’t realised their owner is dead. The percentage of live chondrocytes can be used forensically to estimate the time of death when it’s obviously longer than hours."
"What is the Pumping Lemma Theorem?

It's just the “Pumping Lemma”. A lemma is a theorem, so you don't need both words.


Some definitions:

A language is a set of words, or strings of letters. A Regular Language is a language for which a machine with a fixed, finite memory can determine if a word is in the language, by reading one letter at a time.

For example, the set of binary representations of numbers divisible by five is a Regular Language.

[math]L=\{0,101,1010,1111,10100\dots\}[/math]

You can write a computer program to determine if a word is in this language that reads one letter at a time from a word, and uses only a finite amount of memory.


A word can be pumped in a language if: some non-empty substring of the word can be replaced with any number of copies, and this will always result in a word in the language.

For example, [math]10010001[/math] can be pumped in [math]L[/math]. There is a substring, identified by the square brackets below:

[math]1[00100]01[/math]

and replacing the substring with any number of copies gives another word in [math]L[/math].

[math]1[] 01[/math]

[math]1[ 00100 ]01[/math]

[math]1[ 00100][ 00100] 01[/math]

[math]1[ 00100][ 00100][ 00100] 01[/math]

[math]\dots[/math]

These are all words in [math]L[/math].


The Pumping Lemma states that

If [math]L[/math] is a Regular Language, then all sufficiently long words in [math]L[/math] can be pumped in [math]L[/math].

“Sufficiently long” means there is some number where this is true of all words longer than that.

For example, in the example language above, all words in [math]L[/math] with more than six letters can be pumped in [math]L[/math].


A “lemma” is a theorem, as I mentioned at the start. A theorem earns the title of “lemma” if it is useful in proving lots of other things. Most often, the Pumping Lemma is used in its contrapositive equivalent, for proving that languages are not Regular.

If, for any number, there is a word in [math]L[/math] longer than that, which cannot be pumped in [math]L[/math], then [math]L[/math] is not a Regular Language.

The elementary example is the language

[math]L=\{ab, aabb, aaabbb, aaaabbbb,\dots\}[/math]

Any word from this language, no matter how long, cannot be pumped in [math]L[/math], so [math]L[/math] is not a Regular Language.

This may be surprising. It is not possible to write a computer program using fixed, finite memory, that can read in one letter at a time and decide if a word is in this language! You might think you can, but it won't work in all cases!"
"Arshad Nadeem wins Javelin Gold with an Olympic record. Neeraj Chopra bags silver with the second best throw in his career. What's your take on it?

Arshad Nadeem is the greatest athlete Pakistan has produced in its entire history, a genuine world-class athlete who set not one but the two highest javelin throws ever in an Olympic match. The feat is undeniably worthy of respect, especially considering he had to rely on money from his fellow villagers to even break into events at first, and earlier this year had to petition for a new javelin just for training purposes.

It's pretty clear Pakistan's sporting infrastructure isn't anywhere near India's, let alone other dominating European countries, which really drives home the point that it's the size of the fight in the athlete, not the money behind him that speaks.

I was hoping for a Neeraj Chopra gold medal like a billion others, but a silver medal in a sport India had never even slightly penetrated into at the Olympics prior to him is no mean feat at all. I was a bit afraid of Anderson with his 2022 93+ m PB, but I'm glad we atleast retained the silver medal amidst a very competitive and high-level Olympic javelin event.

Overall? A happy victory for India, a fantastic victory for South Asia. India/Pakistan are now the champions of an entire sport, and have broken a hegemony convincingly with two back to back Olympic performances. I'm reasonably happy, all things considered.

On a lighter note, we might have just seen the future PM of Pakistan."
"What are some popular phrases, sentences, and words used by young people in Japan?

""タイパ"" (taipa)

The term ""タイパ"" (taipa) stands for ""time performance"" and measures the efficiency of time sacrificed for utility or satisfaction. Recently, it has symbolized Generation Z's values and was selected as one of the ""new words of the year"" for 2022 (Sanseido [ https://prtimes.jp/main/html/rd/p/000000121.000014647.html ]).

""What is this time for?""

Faced with time that lacks a specific agenda, we often find ourselves asking this.

And so, we:

* watch videos at double speed, believing regular speed is a waste of time and often skipping unnecessary scenes.
* use short content to quickly consume information, maximizing exposure and freeing up time for other tasks.
* utilize downtime to complete tasks, such as replying to emails or multitasking while watching videos.
* search on social media for immediate information, finding it faster and more intuitive than traditional methods.
* communicate online to save time by eliminating travel and wait times, making webinars and remote work increasingly popular.
* prefer spoiler consumption by seeking information beforehand to avoid wasting time on unsatisfactory products or services.
* actively use time-saving tools like robot vacuums and meal kit deliveries to reduce the time spent on chores.
In addition to work, household chores, and parenting, there's been a rise in ""must-do tasks"" driven by future anxieties, such as side jobs and skill development.

Often, these tasks can be trivial, and our choices may be unnecessary.

Yet, instead of evaluating these decisions or questioning ourselves to avoid being ruled by time performance, we find comfort in pretending to be busy.

Thus, driven by the desire for high returns with minimal investment, we become slaves to time investment - let ourselves be slaves.

* If there are places we cannot reach by simply indulging in immediate pleasures, we will go through life unaware of them.
* Many valuable things can only be obtained through patience and effort, and if the most important aspects of life require relentless dedication, we may leave this world without ever discovering what truly matters.
* In growing older, we miss the joys experienced by the previous generation, who were fortunate to live in a slightly inconvenient era.
After all, what is this life for?"
"My professor said I plagiarized my essay. However, I didn't copy it, I used ChatGPT. How is this fair?

But you did copy it. Specifically, you copied it from the output of ChatGPT. That’s still plagiarism.

Plagiarism means presenting text or ideas that you did not create yourself as your own. It doesn’t matter whether the source of that plagiarism was another essay, or Wikipedia, or your great-uncle Ludwig, or ChatGPT, or stone tablets inscribed by God Herself. If you didn’t write it yourself, it’s plagiarism."
"What would have happened election-wise if the assassination attempt was successful?

In all probability, it would have meant that Ron DeSantis would have become the 47th President of the United States.

The Republicans would have to choose a new candidate of course. But the MAGA movement would be in the absolute ascendancy. And the closest thing they could get to Trump would be DeSantis. I imagine he would sweep in from the wings with little opposition.

And at the general election, I imagine he would ride to a comfortable victory over Biden with pretty much everything in his favour. He is young and dynamic in contrast the Biden which - up until a few days ago - the country was obsessed with his age and declining faculties. He would also ride the sympathy wave in favour of the fallen Trump. And he would also benefit from apathy wing who don’t care that much but would assume “well, the Democrats said the election was about stopping Trump to save democracy, and he is not Trump.”

So I think DeSantis probably wins the Presidency quite comfortably in that alternate universe."
"What's the difference between plainsawn and quartersawn?

2 great textual answers here already. I’m going to go pictorial all over this one. A picture is worth 1000 words right?

Here’s a quarter sawn log illustration:

As you can see, it makes a lot of boards of different widths, radially, from the center of the log. There’s also a fair big of waste. The tradeoff is waste vs board stability when dried.

And here’s what the grain of the wood looks like (red oak in this example):

Here’s the end grain:

Now, let’s look at plain sawn:

already, you can see there’s less waste.

the grain is strikingly different (side-by-side), and you get a picture of the third, less-common variant, because positioning for cutting is such a pain, and even more waste, rift sawn.

And here you can see why it is much more prone to warping. Swelling and contraction are more likely to follow the growth lines, resulting in a warp. (slab = plain sawn)

Edit1:

Several people have commented that the waste isn’t really waste, it goes into other products. This is entirely true as far as the lumber process goes. It might go into pulp products like paper or cardboard. It might go to OSB. It might go to many other things. It isn’t entirely waste. Waste, in the context of the cuts relates to the immediate product with respect to the quality of the wood. The goal is to use 100% of good quality wood on finish product, whatever that is, where there is more revenue potential. If you can’t, then the odd triangular pieces, sawdust, etc. is referred to as waste, even if it is going to a secondary, lower-value use. And yes, mills will do everything that they can to avoid it."
"Is it appropriate to use the term ""anata"" when addressing a girl in Japan? Is it only used for girlfriends?

I was at Anime Expo earlier this month. I went to Uesaka Sumire’s panel, and at the end of the panel, they were allowing questions from the audience.

One guy got the microphone, and it was obvious that he learned Japanese right before this panel as an attempt to impress her. He asked Sumire, “What is your favorite song?” (Sumire is a singer and songwriter). Unfortunately, he phrased the sentence as: “Anata no suki na kyoku wa nan desu ka?”

I’m no native speaker of Japanese speaker myself, but when I heard him use “anata”, I legitimately cringed. Luckily, Sumire is a much more forgiving person than I am, so she still responded to his question with politeness.

The proper way to address someone in Japan is to use their last name plus “san”, so he should have asked: “Uesaka-san no suki na kyoku wa nan desu ka?” However, to English speaker, this is a really weird way to phrase a question. We never address someone in the third person form when talking to them, but this is how you talk in Japanese.

When I first learned Japanese, all of the sources I used said something like, “Using second person pronoun in Japanese is tricky. You should only use anata when…” Honestly speaking, for people who are new to the Japanese language, I think it is better tell them that in Japanese, there are no second person pronouns. Of course, this is untrue, but I can’t think of a single situation where a beginner in the Japanese language would ever have to use “anata” or any other second person pronouns.

I was in Japan this past February. I talked to everyone that I could with my limited Japanese. During my time in Japan, there was not a single situation where I had to use “anata” or some other form of second person pronouns. (I was actually more torn on whether I should use “watashi” or “boku” to refer to myself, lol)"
"In hindsight and as a Singaporean do you feel as though opening Singapore's first casino in Singapore was a blessing or a mistake? Did it create social problems? If so, did the benefits outweigh the social problems they have caused?

Well, to be accurate, Singapore granted two casino licenses, one to Las Vegas Sands and the other to Genting.

People tend to remember only marina bay sands, because the other is tucked away on sentosa.

The last time I was at the latter, I was surprised by the number of Malaysia registered vehicles at the carpark. There were even a few Thai plates. I was there for a show at the attached theater. It is an INTEGRATED resort, after all.

Now, why were sands and Genting chosen? To my mind, they had the connections to bring in the hottest acts from both east and west, and firmly establish Singapore on the international tour circuit.

Not that casino operations haven't been profitable here. Far from it. But the predatory practices common elsewhere are largely absent in Singapore. Singapore does not have an organized crime presence, while moneylending is a licensed and heavily regulated industry.

Beyond the daily entrance levy chargeable for Singapore residents, there is an additional, more effective safeguard against financial ruin due to problem gambling—the HDB flat, which is linked to the retirement account. Many people do not know that the HDB unit is excluded from the flat owner's list of assets in the event of a personal bankruptcy. Creditors cannot make a claim on a HDB property, if at least one owner is a Singapore citizen. Since the majority stay in public housing, schemes to seize property to repay gambling debts are dead in the water.

Among my parents’ crowd, that is older, social gamblers, they prefer the more affordable cruise to nowhere option, where the casino rooms open once the ship reaches international waters. I've heard of a few problem cases, but the bad debts are exclusively among friends, because the casino management will not extend credit, just like in the IRs.

Overall, the licensed money lenders have not fueled gambling addiction. The introduction of the IRs have not fostered an increase in crime, or gambling related issues, either (problem gambling has remained stable at 1% of the population). The junkets are also among the cleanest in the Asia pacific, ahead of Australia, and Macau.

On balance, I'd say sands and Genting are seen as healthy (if pricy) family entertainment centers rather than sleazy, crime infested addiction dens."
"What was Lee Kuan Yew’s thought about Ferdinand Marcos? Did they had a good relationship between them or did he despise him as an evil and incompetent leader?

A2A.

In the second volume of his memoirs From Third World to First (2001), Lee Kuan Yew describes Ferdinand Marcos as pretty much a crook who did little but pillaged his own country and sent his ill-gotten gains to the US even as the country was heading for an economic disaster (unlike his good friend Suharto, the “mega-sultan” who became fabulously rich but at least kept his wealth in Indonesia and still managed to improve its economy by leaps and bounds until the Asian Financial Crisis struck)."
"Is changing a job considered bad in Japan?

For women in their late twenties or early thirties, changing jobs might not be viewed as outright negative, but it often attracts caution and scrutiny.


I’ve mentioned before why people might be hesitant to switch jobs, but if you’re a woman in her late twenties or early thirties, there’s another reason for this reluctance.

Whether married or single, if you’re in this age range, employers may be wary, thinking, “We don’t know when she might take a long break for marriage or childbirth.” As a result, finding a new job can be difficult.


The average age of Japanese women at the time of their first childbirth is 30.9 years old (source: 2021 Vital Statistics). Timing a job change can be challenging for women in their late twenties or early thirties who wish to have children.

Although the legal framework for childcare and family care leave is in place, it has not yet become fully established in society, and the specifics and implementation of these policies vary by company, leading to uncertainty for many women.

As a result, many women ask about maternity and parental leave during job interviews, which can make interviewers wary, thinking, “Is she considering joining our company just to have a baby?""

* Indeed, it’s not uncommon to see cases where women announce their pregnancy soon after changing jobs.
* While it’s a happy event, from the company’s perspective, it creates a problematic situation: They’ve invested time, effort, and recruitment costs into hiring someone who then leaves shortly after. The HR personnel who hired the employee may also face pressure from within the company.
* Although pregnancy shortly after a job change can sometimes be coincidental, it can still lead to significant backlash in the new workplace, affecting both you and the company.
If you are a woman in your late twenties or early thirties and decide to change jobs, you may need to choose your job carefully, which often means delaying starting a family.

Additionally, unless you explicitly state that you have no intention of having children or taking maternity leave, you might be treated as a potential troublemaker who might “come to the company just to have a baby.”


Changing jobs is often seen as a way to enhance skills and broaden opportunities.

However, for women in their late twenties, it carries the significant risk of undermining one of their key advantages."
"What’s the saddest thing you’ve seen at your job?

The increasing trend in Japan of people having others handle their job resignations for them.

In Japan, resignation services, known as “taishoku daiko” (退職代行サービス), have become a common phenomenon.

These services, which cost around 30,000 to 50,000 yen, handle the resignation process for employees, from notifying the company to dealing with the aftermath.

Imagine you are one of the Japanese employees.

Being overwhelmed and afraid to confront your boss, you used a resignation service. While efficient, your departure was marked by unspoken frustration and fear. This isn’t a rare occurrence but part of a growing trend where direct confrontation is avoided.

This trend highlights a broader issue:

* Many people avoid direct communication about job dissatisfaction.
* They opt for quick fixes instead of addressing the root cause for a lasting solution.
Relying on these services can lower the barrier to quitting, leading to a cycle of job-hopping without addressing underlying issues. It’s like using a bandage for a deeper injury — while it may cover the issue temporarily, it doesn’t heal the wound.


While resignation services offer a quick exit, tackling workplace issues head-on is more rewarding for long-term career growth and satisfaction.

Yet, an increasing number of Japanese people seem to get this wrong these days."
"Is [math]\pi^3[/math] irrational?

That is a good question.

Johannes Heinrich Lambert proved [math]\pi[/math] irrational in 1761 by discovering the properties of the tangent function.

By discovering properties about the sine function, Charles Hermite proved that [math]\pi^2[/math] is irrational.

But what of [math]\pi^3[/math]?

To solve this, we consideer two theorems- the Lindemann-Weierstrass Theorem and Euler’s Identity.

We assume[math] \pi^3 [/math]is rational.

There exists integers [math]P[/math] and [math]Q[/math] such that

[math]\frac{P}{Q}=\pi^3[/math]

As [math]\pi [/math]is a positive real number, so is[math] \pi^3[/math]

We can assume [math]P[/math] and [math]Q[/math] are positive integers.

Multiply by [math]Q[/math].

[math]Q\pi^3=P[/math]

Subtract [math]P[/math]

[math]Q\pi^3-P=0[/math]

We can easily see that [math]\pi^3[/math] would be a solution to the linear equation over[math] \Z[/math] [math]Qx-P=0[/math]

Now, ley [math]y^3=x[/math]

[math]\pi [/math]would be a solution to the cubic equation over [math]\Z[/math] [math]Qy^3-P=0[/math], and as such [math]\pi[/math] would be algebraic.

Algebraic numbers form a field, so if [math]i^2+1=0[/math], then [math]i\pi[/math] would be algebraic.

If [math]i\pi[/math] were algebraic, then [math]i\pi[/math] and [math]0[/math] would be distinct algebraic numbers.

According to the Lindemann-Weierstrass Theorem, the sums of natural antilogs of distinct algebraic numbers can never equal zero. So the sum of the natural antilogs of [math]i\pi[/math] and [math]0[/math] would not equal zero.

But Euler’s identity states that the sum of the natural antilogs of [math]i\pi[/math] and [math]0[/math] equals [math]0[/math].

We have a contradiction.

We must conclude that

[math]\pi^3 [/math](about [math]31.0063[/math]) is irrational."
"Was Mrs. Thatcher expected to be a successful Prime Minister before she took office?

I think most people expected her to fail and fail badly.

Back when Thatcher became PM she was one of just seven female MPs in Parliament. It was a man’s world, and people were not shy about expressing the view that it should remain so. I remember reading a book once which talked about when Thatcher become leader of the Tory Party and leader of the opposition (before she won the general election) the party apparatchiks who were still largely loyal to Ted Heath (who loathed Thatcher) literally went out of their way to obstruct her as much as possible and make her life as difficult as they could.

You didn’t have to be a cynic to assume that they were probably going to succeed, and that her leadership of the party would crash and burn. But she routed her opponents and silenced the doubters, and became the country’s longest serving PM in centuries. I recall the media were also pretty hostile too - openly questioning whether it was appropriate for a woman to be in charge of the UK’s nuclear deterrent.

It is sort of ironic that she is so loathed by the progressive left today. Because as an example of a woman who took on the oppressive patriarchy and absolutely crushed them, she is hard to beat."
